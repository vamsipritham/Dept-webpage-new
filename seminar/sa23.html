      <td> Shape optimization problems typically lead to optimization
problems with PDE constraints, where the shape design space is rather
low dimensional compared to the state space. Reduced SQP techniques are
most appropriate in this context. We will present numerical
implementations of reduced SQP methods and also of pseudo-time stepping
extensions of them. The field of applications reported on will be the
design of turbine blades and the design of parts of airplanes, the
latter of which is the topic of current collaborations with Airbus
industries. </td>
