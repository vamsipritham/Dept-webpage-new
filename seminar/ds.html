      <td> Over the last decade, codes defined over graphs have gained
widespread attention from the coding community. They have been shown to
perform remarkably well over several communication channels, closely
approaching the theoretical limits. A primary reason for their
importance are the iterative decoding algorithms that operate on the
graph representing the code and whose complexity grows only linearly in
the size of the code. This talk will present some classes of codes that
can be represented on graphs, focusing primarily on low-density parity
check (LDPC) codes. The iterative decoding algorithm and some
construction techniques in the design of LDPC codes will be presented.
Several parameters such as girth, diameter, and expansion of the graph
have been shown to affect the decoding performance. More fundamental
than these are so-called pseudo-code words that are specific to the
graph structure. Some of these terms will be made more precise in this
talk. </td>
