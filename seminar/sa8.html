      <td> The notion of "curvature on isotropic 2-planes" was
introduced by Micallef and Moore.  This curvature is intimately related
to the second variation of the area functional in a Riemannian
manifold.  We will begin by describing the theorem of Micallef-Moore
that a compact simply connected manifold of positive isotropic
curvature is homeomorphic to the sphere.  We will describe our work in
the second half which shows, in contrast to the Micallef-Moore theorem
that every compact 4-manifold admits a metric of negative isotropic
curvature. </td>
