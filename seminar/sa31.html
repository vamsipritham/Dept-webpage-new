      <td> The title may sound technical but the talk is not planned to
be so. Nearly all of it (and not just the traditional first 20
minutes) should be accessible to a beginning graduate student---in fact
to anybody familiar with the rudiments of linear algebra, calculus, and
topology. We will first define the terms in the title---better still,
we will look at some examples to get an idea of what they mean.   The
theorem is about certain invariants (multiplicity, Hilbert function) of
singularities on Schubert varieties. in Grassmannians (ordinary,
symplectic, orthogonal).   But we will avoid jargon and try to get a
feel for what is involved. </td>
