The department hosts postdocs having various external Postdoctoral fellowships. If you wish to join the department as a psotdoc, please apply for one of these. You may wish to contact a [faculty member](faculty.html) in an area related to your work.

Some of the fellowships to which you may apply are:

* [NBHM Postdoctoral Fellowship](http://www.nbhm.dae.gov.in/postdoct.html)
* [U.G.C. Kothari Fellowship](http://ugcdskpdf.unipune.ac.in/)
* [National Postdoctoral Fellowship](http://www.serb.gov.in/npdf.php)

The Indian Institute of Science currently does not have its own post-doctoral fellowships. However some members of our [faculty](faculty.html) may have grants that can support a post-doctoral position.
