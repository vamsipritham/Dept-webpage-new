This topics course is being run as an experiment in approaching the basic concepts in several complex variables with the eventual aim of studying some topics in multi-variable complex dynamics. By "complex dynamics", we mean the the study of the dynamical system that arises in iterating a holomorphic map.

The course will begin with a complete and rigorous introduction to holomorphic functions in several variables and their basic properties. This will pave the way to motivating and studying a concept that is, perhaps, entirely indigenous to several complex variables: the notion of plurisubharmonicity.

Next, we shall look at some of the motivations behind the study of complex dynamics in several variables. Using the tools developed, we shall undertake a crash-course in currents, which are objects central to the study of some aspects of complex dynamics. We shall then cover as much of the following topics as time permits:

* Properties of fixed points
* The existence of proper subdomains of $C^n$, $n \geq 2$, that are holomorphically equivalent to $C^n$
* The Fatou and the Julia set for a dominant holomorphic self-map of $CP^n$, $n \geq 2$
* The Green current associated to a dominant holomorphic self-map of $CP^n$, and the dynamical information that it provides.
