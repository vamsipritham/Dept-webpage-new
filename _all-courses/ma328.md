**Preliminaries:**   Holomorphic  functions in $C^n$ : definition , the generalized Cauchy integral formula, holomorphic  functions: power series development(s),  circular  and Reinhardt  domains,  analytic  continuation : basic  theory and comparisons  with  the  one- variable theory.

**Convexity theory:** Analytic continuation:  the  role  of  convexity,  holomorphic convexity,  plurisub-harmonic  functions,  the Levi problem and  the  role  of  the d-bar  equation.

**The d- bar equation:**  Review of distribution theory, Hormanderâ€™s  solution  and  estimates  for  the   d-bar operator.
