* Serre-Frenet formula for curves, Parametric surfaces, Isothermal parameters,
* Gauss Map, Gaussian Curvature, Mean curvature, Area functional etc.

* Surfaces that locally minimise area in Euclidean space (minimal surfaces).
* Harmonic coordinates in isothermal parameters. Examples of minimal surfaces.

* Minimal surfaces with boundary: Plateau's problem.

* The gauss map for minimal surfaces with some examples.

* The Weierstrass-Enneper representation of minimal surfaces. Many more examples
of minimal surfaces.

* Conjugate minimal surfaces. One parameter family of isometric minimal surfaces.
the Bjorling problem and Schwartz's solution to it.

If time permits:

* Surfaces that locally maximise area in Lorenztian space (maximal surfaces). A
lot of examples and analogous results, as in minimal surface theory, for
maximal surfaces.

* Connection betwen minimal and maximal surfaces and Born Infeld solitions.
* Constant mean curvature surfaces of non-zero mean curvature (the optimization
problem they solve)
