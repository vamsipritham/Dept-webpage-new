The first half of the course will focus on convergence
theory of Riemannian manifolds.
Gromov-Hausdorff convergence, Lipschitz convergence and collapsing
theory will be discussed.

The second half will be about the Ricci flow. Existence and
uniqueness, maximum principles and
Hamilton's theorem for 3-manifolds with positive Ricci curvature will
be covered.
