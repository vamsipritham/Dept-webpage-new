This course is an introduction to logic and foundations from both a modern point of view (based on type theory and its relations to topology) as well as in the traditional formulation based on first-order logic.

Topics:

* Basic type theory: terms and types, function types, dependent types, inductive types.
* First order logic: First order languages, deduction and truth, Models, Godel's completeness and compactness theorems.
* Godel's incompleteness theorem
* Homotopy Type Theory: propositions as types, the identity type family, topological view of the identity type, foundations of homotopy type theory.
* Most of the material will be developed using the dependently typed language/proof assistant Agda. Connections with programming in functional languages will be explored.
