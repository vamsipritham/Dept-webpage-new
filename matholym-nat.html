	         <p>Mathematics Olympiad activity on a national level has been one of the NBHM's major initiatives since 1986. One of the main purposes of this activity is to spot mathematical talent amont High School children. NBHM has also taken on the responsibility for selecting and training the India team for participating in the International Olympiad every year. <br><br>

	<!--	 For the purpose of administering Olympiad contest, the country has been divided in 16 regions.   The Olympiad Programme leading to India's participation in the International Mathematical Olympiad            (IMO) consists of the following stages: <br><br>
			<b>Stage 1: Regional Mathematics Olympiad (RMO)</b>: RMO is held normally between September and the first Sunday of December each year in different regions in the country. All school students of Class XI are eligible to appear for RMO. This Olympiad is a 3-hour written tets containing about 6 to 7 problems. On the basis of the performance in the RMO, a certain number of students from each region is selected to appear for th second stage. Reginal coordinators charge nominal fees to meet the expenses for organising the contest.                   <br><br><b>Stage 2: Indian National Mathematics Olympiad (INMO):</b> INMO is held on the first Sunday of February each year at various centres in different regions. Only students selected on the basis of RMO from different regions are eligible to apear for INMO. INMO is a 4-hour written test; the question paper is set centrally and is common throughout the country. The top 30-35 performers in INMO receive a certificate of    Merit. <br>
			<br><b>Stage 3: International Mathematics Olympiad Training Camp (IMOTC)</b>: The UNMO            certificates awardess are invited to a month long Training Camp in May/June each year. In addition, INMO      awardess of the previous year who have satisfactorily gone through postal tuition throughout the year are invited again to a second round of training. On the basis of a number of selection tests through the Camp, a team of the best six students is selected from the combined people of junior and senior batch participants to        represent India in the Internation Mathematics Olympiad. <br><br>
			<b>Stage 4:International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO)</b>: The six-member team selected at the end  of the Camp accompanied by a leader and a deputy leader represent India at the IMO that is normally held  in July in a different country. IMO consist of two 4-and-a-half hour written tests held on two days with a gap of at elast one day. Travel to IMO venue and return takes about two weeks. Student of the India team who     receive gold, silver and bronze medals at IMO receive from NBHM a cash prize of Rs. 5000/-, Rs. 4000/- and    Rs. 3000/- respectively during the following year at a formal ceremony at the end of the Training Camp. MHRD 
finances international travel of the 8-member Indian delegation	while NBHM (DAE) finances he entire in-countryprogramme and takes care of other expenditure connected with international participation. <br><br>
             <b>Syllabus for Mathematics Olympiad</b>: the syllabus for mathematics olypiads (regional, national and international) is  pre-degree college mathematics. The difficulty level increases from RMO to INMO to IMO. A good idea of what is expected of students in mathematics olympiads can be had from the following two books: </p><ol><li><i>Mathematics Olympiad Primer</i>, by V. Krishnamurthy,  C.R. Pranesachar,          K.N. Ranganathan and B.J. Venkatachala (Interline Publishing Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore). </li><li><i>Challenge and Thrill of Pre-College Mathematics</i>, by  V. Krishnamurthy, C.R.
