	      <p style="margin-top: +20">The Department of Mathematics, through its Integrated Ph.D. programme, offers exciting opportunities to talented students holding a Bachelor's
degree for acquiring a rigorous and modern education in mathematics, and for pursuing research in both pure and applied mathematics.</p>


	      <p>Admission to the Integrated Ph.D. (Int. Ph.D.) Programme in the Mathematical Sciences is through the Joint Admission Test for M.Sc. <a
href="http://jam.iitm.ac.in/jam2016/" target="_blank">(JAM)</a> followed by an interview (of those candidates who are short-listed) at IISc.</p>

	      <p>Click <a href="http://jam.iitm.ac.in/jam2016/" target="_blank">here</a> and follow the link that says <b>Information Brochure</b> for the syllabi for the relevant JAM
examinations</p>

	      <p><font color="#CB7700"><b>SEVERAL CHANGES
HAVE OCCURRED in the admissions process to the Int. Ph.D. programme in the Mathematical Sciences at IISc. Please read what follows CAREFULLY!</b></font </p>


	      <h3>Eligibility</h3>
               <ul>
                <li><font color="#CB7700"><b>PLEASE NOTE:</b> You will <b>not</b> see the Int. Ph.D. programme in the Mathematical Sciences listed in any of the eligibility-criteria
tables in any of the documents posted at the JAM 2016 website! Instead <b>please read the following points.</b></font> <br><br> </li>

                <li>Aspirants for the Int. Ph.D. in the Mathematical Sciences must write the JAM 2016 examination. However, an aspirant who has qualified in JAM 2016
<font color="#CB7700"><b>will need to apply separately to IISc through our admissions portal</b></font> <b>(see below).</b> Additionally, <b>THE NEXT THREE POINTS SHALL
BE THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS</b> for the Int. Ph.D. in the Mathematical Sciences. <br><br> </li>

                <li>First Class or equivalent grade in:
		    <ul>
		     <li><p style="margin-top: +5">B.Sc. or equivalent degree with Mathematics as one of the subjects (this includes the B.Stat. degree, and a B.A. degree with
			Mathematics as one of the subjects); OR </p>
		     </li>
		     <li><p style="margin-top: +5">B.E./B.Tech. or equivalent degree</p>
		     </li>
		    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Please note that candidates with higher qualifications are
                  not eligible. <br>
                  <br>
	        </li>
		<li>Candidates can appear for either the Mathematics (MA) or the Mathematical Statistics (MS) JAM paper. <br>
		    <br>
                </li>
                <li> <!-- Candidates should have qualified in JAM 2015 <b>and marked IISc as one of their
		  preferences</b> on the online application available to qualified candidates when JAM 2015 results are declared.-->
		  A short-list of candidates who have applied to the IISc, and determined by the JAM 2016 score,
will be drawn up. The short-listed candidates will be invited for an interview at IISc. <font color="#CB7700">The interview short-list
and any subsequent offer of admission <b>will be totally independent of the candidate's preferences (for any other programmes) made via JAM 2016.</b></font>
           	</li>
               <!-- <li>All candidates should qualify in IISc Entrance Test 2005.
                  The short-listing of candidates for interview is done based
                  on performance in the IISc Entrance Test. Selection will be
                  based on the combined performance in the entrance test and interview.
                </li>-->
              </ul>
<p>Candidates who are yet to complete their examinations for the eligible degree <b>and</b> expect to complete <b>all</b> the requirements for
their degree (including all examinations, project dissertations, viva voce, etc.) before July 31, 2016, are eligible to apply.
