The Ph.D. Programme

See also: The_Integrated_Ph.D._Degree_Programme
The Department of Mathematics offers excellent opportunities for research in
both pure and applied mathematics. Visit this_page to get a sense of the
research interests of the faculty in the department.
The written test conducted by IISc for entrance to the Ph.D. programme has been
discontinued as of 2013. Students will be selected through the examinations
listed below, followed by an interview at IISc.

Eligibility


* Minimum second-class or equivalent grade in the qualifying examination/degree
  (which is relaxed to a "pass class" for SC/ST candidates). See below for
  degrees that qualify.

* Master's degree in the Mathematical or Physical Sciences, or B.E./B.Tech. (or
  equivalent degree) in an appropriate field of Engineering or Technology.

* The candidate should also have passed one of the following entrance tests:
  CSIR-UGC NET for JRF, or UGC-NET for JRF, or GATE (all of these to be valid
  as of August 1, 2016), or the NBHM 2016 Screening Test; or must hold an
  INSPIRE Ph.D. fellowship.

* Concerning candidates who have passed one of the above examinations: only
  eligible candidates who have been short-listed on the basis of their scores
  in one of the above examinations will be called for the interview.
  Note: the short-list for NBHM 2016 will be based only on the NBHM 2016
  screening test.
  Selection to the Ph.D. programme will be based on performance in the
  interview.

Candidates who are yet to complete their examinations for the eligible degree
and expect to complete all the requirements for their degree (including all
examinations, project dissertations, viva voce, etc.) before July 31, 2016, are
eligible to apply.
