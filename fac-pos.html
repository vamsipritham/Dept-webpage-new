              <p align="justify">The Indian Institute of Science is a premier Institute 
                of higher learning and research in the country. It has more than 
                40 departments/centres/units and nearly 450 faculty members pursuing 
                research in many areas of science and engineering.</p>
              <p align="justify"> The Department of Mathematics has established itself as an 
                excellent centre for research in both pure and applied mathematics. It has a small 
                but active research faculty, and seeks mathematicians who will add to the research 
                profile of the department. In addition to the regular (i.e. post-M.Sc./M.Tech.) Ph.D. 
                programme, the Department has an Integrated Ph.D. programme that admits students with 
                plans for research in mathematics right after their Bachelors degree. <br>
              </p>
              <p align="justify">The Department of Mathematics welcomes applications in all 
                fields of mathematics from researchers who are exceptionally motivated, and 
                have an established record of independent, high-quality research, for Assistant 
                Professorships in the Department of Mathematics. </p>
              <p align="justify">Prospective candidates must have a Ph.D. (in 
                relevant area) and must have completed three years of post-doctoral
                research at the time of appointment (relaxable in exceptional cases) 
                and, preferably, be below 35 years of age. </p>
              <p align="justify">The salary will be in the pay grade Rs. 30,000+8,000
                per month (basic salary for this designation plus grade pay) plus allowances
                --- with raises each year. The total monthly pay includes:</p>
		<ul>
                 <li> Dearness Allowance (DA), which currently (as of 
                 November, 2013) stands at 90% of 
                 one's basic plus grade pay (and which is usally revised every 6 months);</li>
                 <li> Transport Allowance, which currently stands at Rs. 3200 plus 
                  90% (this supplement is at the prevailing rate of the DA, and rises along with it).</li>
		</ul>
               <p align="justify"> Thus, the total emoluments, at present, for this pay grade
                 stand at Rs. 78,280 per month. Additionally, a newly-appointed Assistant Professor
                 can either opt for virtually rent-free on-campus housing, or claim a House Rent
                 Allowance of Rs. 11,400 (i.e. 30% of Rs. 38,000). </p>
              <p align="justify">At the end of three years' service, an Assistant Professor's
                 pay is raised to the pay grade Rs. 37,400+9000 per month. At the current 
                 rates of exchange, 1 US dollar = Rs. 61.50 approximately; also 1 
                 <i>PPP</i>-US dollar = Rs. 23.65 (approximately)
                 which is the effective value of the US dollar against the rupee
                 adjusted for <i>P</i>urchasing <i>P</i>ower <i>P</i>arity (<i>source:</i>

              <p align="justify">Interested candidates may apply by sending a curriculum vitae,
                 list of publications along with reprints of important publications, a description
                 of proposed research, names and addresses (with e-mail and fax number) of at least
                 three referees, and any other relevant details to:</p>

             <h3>Some useful tips</h3>

              <p align="justify" style="margin-top: -10">In case you have decided to apply to the Department of Mathematics at
               the Indian Institute of Science, here are a few points that might be useful to bear in mind.</p>

              <ol>
               <li> The Department of Mathematics aims to recruit, over time, mathematicians with increasingly
			strong academic records. Thus, if you are interested in applying and there are colleagues in the
			department who work in your area of interest, then you might find it helpful to talk/write to a colleague
			who was hired <b>relatively recently</b> to get a sense of the prevailing standards in hiring.
			<br>
			<br>
               <li> Please take a look at <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/newfacultyiisc/recruitment">this webpage</a> to
			get a sense of the steps in the recruitment procedure at the Indian Institute of Science. While
			<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/newfacultyiisc/recruitment">
			https://sites.google.com/site/newfacultyiisc/recruitment</a> is not a webpage authorized by the
			Indian Institute of Science, the information on it is fairly representative of applications to
			the Department of Mathematics.
			<br>
			<br>
               <li> One of consequences of a rolling process of recruitment is that, as alluded to in (2), a decision
			on your application could take as little as 3 months or <b>as long as 8&ndash;9 months</b>. In case
			your mailing address changes in the interim, <b>please be sure to communicate any changes in
			your address.</b>
			<br>
			<br>
               <li> Since the eventual settlement of <b>all</b> job applications (numbering in the hundreds) across all
			departments is done
			centrally, it might not be possible for the Registrar to notify applicants individually that a
			position has been filled. However, feel free to contact the Chairman, Department of
			Mathematics, a few months into
			the process to inquire informally about your application.
              </ol>
