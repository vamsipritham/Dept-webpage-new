title: Homological Invariants and Combinatorics of Finite Simple Graphs

In this talk the interplay between the combinatorial structures
of finite simple graphs and various homological invariants like
regularity, depth etc. of related algebraic objects shall be discussed.
Some open problems, recent developments and ongoing projects shall be
discussed. In particular some new techniques developed in my thesis to
study Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of algebraic objects related to
graphs shall be discussed in some details.
