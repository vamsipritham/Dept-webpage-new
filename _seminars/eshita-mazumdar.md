For a finite abelian group $G$ with $|G| = n$, the Davenport
Constant $DA(G)$ is defined to be the least integer $k$ such that any sequence
$S$ with length $k$ of elements in $G$ has a non-empty $A$ weighted zero-sum
subsequence. For certain sets $A$, we already know the precise value of
constant corresponding to the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$.
But for different group $G$
and $A$, the precise value of it is still an open question. We try to find
out bounds for these combinatorial invariant for random set $A$. We got few
results in this connection. In this talk I would like to present those
results and discuss about an extremal problem related to this
combinatorial invariant.
