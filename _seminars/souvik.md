In algebraic geometry the concept of height pairing (a particular example
of linking numbers) of algebraic cycles lies at the confluence of arithmetic,
Hodge theory and topology. In a series of two talks, I will explain the
notion
of Beilinson’s height pairing for cycles homologous to zero. This will bring
into picture the notion of Arakelov/arithmetic intersection theory. I will
give
sufficient background of this theory and provide examples. Finally, I will
talk
about my recent work with Dr. Jose Ignacio Burgos, about a generalization
of Beilinson’s height pairing for higher algebraic cycles.
