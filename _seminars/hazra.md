title: "Homogeneous Operators"
---

It is known that the characteristic function $\theta_T$ of a
homogeneous contraction $T$ with an associated representation $\pi$ is of
the form
$\theta_T(a) = \sigma\_{L}(\phi_a)^{*} \theta(0) \sigma\_{R}(\phi\_a),$
where, $\sigma\_{L}$ and $\sigma\_{R}$ are projective representation of the
M\"{o}bius group M\"{o}b with a common multiplier.  We give another proof
of the ``product formula''.

Also, we prove that the projective representations $\sigma\_L$ and
$\sigma\_R$ for a class of multiplication  operators, the two
representations $\sigma\_{R}$ and $\sigma\_{L}$ are unitarily equivalent to
certain known pair of representations $\sigma\_{\lambda + 1}$ and
$\sigma\_{\lambda - 1},$ respectively. These are described explicitly.

Let $G$ be either (i) the direct product of $n$-copies of the
bi-holomorphic automorphism group of the disc or (ii) the bi-holomorphic
automorphism group of the polydisc $\mathbb D^n.$

A commuting tuple of bounded operators $\mathsf{T} = (T\_1, T\_2,\ldots
,T\_n)$ is said to be $G$-homogeneous if the joint spectrum of $\mathsf{T}$
lies in $\overline{\mathbb{D}}^n$ and $\varphi(\mathsf{T}),$ defined using
the usual functional calculus, is unitarily equivalent with $\mathsf{T}$
for all $\varphi \in G.$

We show that a commuting tuple $\mathsf{T}$ in the Cowen-Douglas class  of
  rank $1$ is $G$ - homogeneous if and only if it is unitarily equivalent
to the tuple of the multiplication operators on either the reproducing
kernel Hilbert space with reproducing kernel $\prod\_{i = 1}^{n}
\frac{1}{(1 - z\_{i}\overline{w}\_{i})^{\lambda\_i}}$ or $\prod\_{i = 1}^{n}
\frac{1}{(1 - z\_{i}\overline{w}\_{i})^{\lambda}},$ where $\lambda,$
$\lambda\_i$, $1 \leq i \leq n,$ are positive real numbers, according as
$G$ is as in (i) or (ii).

Let $\mathsf T:=(T\_1, \ldots ,T\_{n-1})$ be a $G$-homogeneous $(n-1)$-tuple
of rank $1$ Cowen-Douglas class, where $G$ is the  the direct product of
$n-1$-copies of the bi-holomorphic automorphism group of the disc.  Let
$\hat{T}$ be an irreducible homogeneous (with respect to the
bi-holomorphic group of automorphisms of the disc) operator in the
Cowen-Douglas class on the disc of rank $2$. We show that every
irreducible $G$ - homogeneous operator, $G$ as in (i), of rank $2$ must be
of the form $(T\_1\otimes I\_{\widehat{H}},\ldots , T\_{n-1}\otimes
I\_{\widehat{H}}, I\_H \otimes \hat{T}).$

We also show that if $G$ is chosen to be the group as in (ii), then there
are no irreducible $G$- homogeneous operators  of rank $2$.
