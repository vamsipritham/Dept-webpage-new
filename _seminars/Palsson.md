As big data sets have become more common, there has been significant
interest in finding and understanding patterns in them. One example of a
simple pattern is the distance between data points, which can be thought of
as a 2-point configuration. Two classic questions, the Erdos distinct
distance problem, which asks about the least number of distinct distances
determined by N points in the plane, and its continuous analog, the
Falconer distance problem, explore that simple pattern. Questions similar
to the Erdos distinct distance problem and the Falconer distance problem
can also be posed for more complicated patterns such as triangles, which
can be viewed as 3-point configurations. In this talk I will present recent
Falconer type theorems, established by myself and my collaborators, for a
wide class of finite point configurations in any dimension. The techniques
we used come from analysis and geometric measure theory, and the key step
was to obtain bounds on multilinear analogues of generalized Radon
transforms.
