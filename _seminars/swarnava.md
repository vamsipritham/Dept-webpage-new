title: Conformal blocks, strange duality and the moduli space of curves
---
Conformal blocks are refined invariants of tensor product of
representations of a Lie algebra that give a special class of vector
bundles on the moduli space of curves. In this talk, I will introduce
conformal blocks and explore connections to questions in algebraic geometry
and representation theory. I will also focus on some ``strange" dualities
in representation theory and how they give equalities of divisor classes
on the moduli space of curves.
