The Pick--Nevanlinna interpolation problem in its fullest generality is as
follows:

Given domains $D_1$, $D_2$ in complex Euclidean spaces, and a set $\{(z_i,w_i):
1\leq i\leq N\}\subset D_1\times D_2$, where $z_i$ are distinct and $N$ is a
positive integer $\geq 2$, find necessary and sufficient conditions for the
existence of a holomorphic map $F$ from $D_1$ into $D_2$ such that $F(z_i) = w_i$,
$1\leq N$.

When such a map $F$ exists, we say that $F$ is an interpolant of the data. Of
course, this problem is intractable at the above level of generality.
However, two special cases of the problem -- which we shall study in this
thesis -- have been of lasting interest:

INTERPOLATION FROM THE POLYDISC TO THE UNIT DISC: This is the case $D_1 =
D^n$ and $D_2 = D$, where $D$ denotes the open unit disc in the complex plane
and $n$ is a positive integer. The problem itself originates with Georg
Pick's well-known theorem (independently discovered by Nevanlinna) for the
case $n=1$. Much later, Sarason gave another proof of Pick's result using an
operator-theoretic approach, which is very influential. Using this
approach for $n\geq 2$, Agler--McCarthy provided a solution to the problem
with the restriction that the interpolant is in the Schur--Agler class.
This is notable because when $n = 2$ the latter result completely solves the
problem for the case $D_1 = D^2$, $D_2 = D$. However, Pick's approach can also
be effective for $n\geq 2$. In this thesis, we give an alternative
characterization for the existence of a $3$-point interpolant based on
Pick's approach and involving the study of rational inner functions.

Cole, Lewis and Wermer lifted Sarason's approach to uniform algebras --
leading to a characterization for the existence of an interpolant in terms
of the positivity of a large, rather abstractly-defined family of $(N\times
N)$ matrices. McCullough later refined their result by identifying a
smaller family of matrices. The second result of this thesis is in the
same vein, namely: it provides a characterization of those data that admit
a $D^n$-to-$D$ interpolant in terms of the positivity of a family of matrices
parametrized by a class of polynomials.


INTERPOLATION FORM THE UNIT DISC TO THE SPECTRAL UNIT BALL: This is the
case $D_1 = D$ and $D_2$ is the set of all $(n\times n)$ matrices with spectral
radius less than $1$. The interest in this arises from problems in Control
Theory. Bercovici, Fois and Tannenbaum adapted Sarason's methods to give a
(somewhat hard-to-check) characterization for the existence of an
interpolant under a very mild restriction. Later, Agler--Young established
a relation between the interpolation problem in the spectral unit ball and
that in the symmetrized polydisc -- leading to a necessary condition for
the existence of an interpolant. Bharali later provided a new inequivalent
necessary condition for the existence of an interpolant for any $n$ and $N=2$.
We shall present a necessary condition for the existence of a $3$-point
interpolant. This we shall achieve by modifying Pick's approach and
applying the aforementioned result due to Bharali.
