title : "Punctual gluing of t-structures in algebraic geometry"
---

The formalism of an "abelian category'' is meant to axiomatize
the operations of linear algebra. From there, the notion of "derived
category'' as the category of complexes "upto quasi-isomorphisms'' is
natural, motivated in part by topology. The formalism of t-structures
allows one to construct new abelian categories which are quite useful in
practice (giving rise to new cohomology theories like intersection
cohomology, for example). In this talk we want to discuss a notion of
punctual (="point-wise'') gluing of t-structures which is possible in the
context of algebraic geometry. The essence of the construction is
classical and well known, but the new language leads to useful
constructions in the motivic world.
