<H1>Travel</H1>

<H3>Airlines</H3>
<P>Bangalore has an international airport, with direct flights to/from Frankfurt
(through Lufthansa), Singapore, the Middle East, London, Paris, New York and Chicago
(all through
<A href="http://www.airindia.com/flights/index.htm">Air India</A>).
Other common ports of entry into India are Mumbai (Bombay), Delhi,
Chennai (Madras) and Kolkata (Calcutta). If coming in through these cities, it is
advisable to get direct fares for Bangalore, since add-on sector fares
from Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Kolkata can be expensive.
Current estimates of round-trip airfare are $1500-$1700 from the USA, 1000 Euro from Europe, and
$1000 from Japan.&nbsp;</P>

<P>Indian local time is ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) by 5:30 hours.
International flights to/from India arrive/depart typically between
midnight and early morning, while Indian domestic flights are mostly
during the daytime. This makes getting good connections difficult.
Only from Mumbai to Bangalore are there early morning flights
by Air India and Jet Airways. Other domestic flights start around 6am.
If you do not have a direct flight to Bangalore, you will have to clear
immigration/customs formalities at your entry-point in India.</P>

<H3>Indian Airports</H3>
<P>In Mumbai and in Delhi, the international and domestic flight terminals
are at different locations, though the flights use the same runway.
All airlines other than Air India require a change of terminals, and
they offer free bus service between the two terminals running around
the clock once every hour. The bus-stops are not clearly marked, so
please ask the airport authorities to direct you to the location of
the bus-stops.</P>

<P>For persons who would like to take a break (particularly to recover
from jetlag or to have a nap), and not mind the price, a convenient
retreat is the
<A href="http://www.centaurhotel.com/">Centaur group of hotels</A>, 
with branches just next to the airports in Mumbai and Delhi. Reservations in less expensive
hotels close to the airports are not easily available, but you may still
ask for them in your e-mail.</P>

<P>All the major Indian airports offer pre-paid taxi service (advisable
if you don't want to argue with the driver later), and hotel/tourist
information. Bangalore city railway station also has a service counter
for pre-paid vehicles.</P>

<H3>Currency Exchange</H3>
<P>The Indian currency is Rupee (1 US$ = 45 Rupees
at the beginning of August 2000; more recent information can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.xe.net/currency/">the Universal Currency Converter</A>).
Currency conversion is possible at airports and banks, although many of
them deal only with US-dollars and British-pounds. At the end of the trip,
rupees can be converted back into foreign currency, only if one has
receipts demonstrating that a larger amount of foreign currency was
converted into rupees earlier during the trip.</P>

<P>If you are carrying large amount of foreign currency (not travellers
cheques but cash), that should be declared at the customs when entering
India. Travellers cheques do not have to be declared and are easier to
carry. Expensive equipment liable to custom duty (e.g. laptop computers
and video cameras) should also be declared at the customs. Such items
will be entered in your passport, and you don't have to pay any duty
provided that you take them back when you return.<P>

<P>International credit cards are accepted at major hotels and shops,
but not everywhere. The HDFC bank close to the conference venue has a
24-hour ATM, where you can use international credit cards to get Indian
currency. The logos of acceptable credit (and debit) cards are shown
alongside. The ATM provides a better exchange rate than that offered by
hotels and shops. (The HDFC bank charges the credit card company Rs.55
per transaction. The amount charged by the credit card company to you
will depend on the agreement between you and your credit card company.)</P>

<H3>Miscellaneous</H3>
<P>Avoid accepting currency notes of denominations Rupee 1,2 and 5; ask
for the corresponding coins instead. The government has stopped printing
these notes, but old damaged and soiled notes are still in circulation.</P>

<P>India uses the metric system of measurements (it is after all the
birthplace of the decimal system). The electricity supply in India is
220 Volts and 50 Hz. Appliances requiring 110 Volts would need a voltage
adapter. The electrical sockets require three (or two) round pin plugs.</P>

<P>Telephone booths with international call facility and internet cafes,
accessible with cash payment, can be found at many street corners in the
cities. Card-operated telephones (magnetic cards or electronic accounts)
exist at many public places (e.g. airports, hotels, IISc guest house).
The cards are issued by the Telecom Department of Government of India,
in denominations of 100, 200, 500, 1000 units. 1 unit costs approximately
1.20 rupee, and works for about 1 minute for local calls and for about
1 second for calls to the USA.</P>
