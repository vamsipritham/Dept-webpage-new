Introduction to Dynamical Systems Theory
The course introduces basic mathematical techniques to understand qualitatively
the long-term behaviour of systems evolving in time. Most of the phenomena
occurring in nature, and around us, are nonlinear in nature and often these
exhibit interesting behaviour which could be unpredictable and
counterintuitive. Tools and techniques of dynamical systems theory help in
understanding the behaviour of systems and in gaining control over their
behaviour, to a certain extent. Dynamical systems theory has wide applications
in the study of complex systems, including physical & biological systems,
engineering, aerodynamics, economics, etc.
