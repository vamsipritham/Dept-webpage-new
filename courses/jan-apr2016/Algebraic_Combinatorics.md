Algebraic Combinatorics
The algebra of symmetric functions, Schur functions, RSK algorithm, Murnaghan-
Nakayama Rule, Hillman-Grassl correspondence, Knuth equivalence, jeu de taquim,
promotion and evacuation, Littlewood-Richardson rules.

No prior knowledge of combinatorics is expected, but a familiarity with linear
algebra and finite groubs will be assumed.
