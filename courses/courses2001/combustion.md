Basic background material on ODE, PDE and fluid mechanics, Conservation laws,
Combustion modelling, Blast waves and detonations, Hamillton-Jacobi equations.
Special topics from one of the following three: (1) Numerics of conservation
laws, (2) Mathematicsal problems in low Mach number combustions, (3) Formation
and propagation of singularities on a nonlinear wavefront in two-dimensions.
