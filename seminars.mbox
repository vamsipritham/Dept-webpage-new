Title: Homogenization of Periodic Optimal Control Problems in a Domain
with highly oscillating boundary

Abstract: Homogenization is a branch of science where we try to understand
microscopic structures via a macroscopic medium. Hence, it has
applications in various branches of science and engineering. This study is
basically developed from material science in the creation of composite
materials though the contemporary applications are much far and wide. It
is a process of understanding the microscopic behavior of an
in-homogeneous medium via a homogenized medium. Mathematically, it is a
kind of asymptotic analysis. We plan to start with an illustrative example
of limiting analysis in 1-D for a second order elliptic partial
differential equation. We will also see some classical results in the case
of periodic composite materials and oscillating boundary domain. The
emphasis will be on the computational importance of homogenization in
numerics by the introduction of correctors. In the second part of the
talk, we will see a study on optimal control problems posed in a domain
with highly oscillating boundary. We will consider periodic controls in
the oscillating part of the domain with a model problem of Laplacian and
try to understand their optimality and asymptotic behavior.

Title: AN INTRODUCTION TO ATLAS: BASIC BACKGROUND AND APPLICATIONS

Speaker: JONATHAN FERNANDES

Date: Aug 14, 2015

Time: 4pm

Location: LH-1

Abstract. Let G_R be the real points of a complex connected reductive al-
gebraic group G defined over R. The Atlas Software is a computational tool,
primarily designed to compute signatures of hermitian forms on hermitian
representations of G_R. The output of the software can be used to compute
a lot more than just Hermitian forms.

In this talk, we will introduce some basic terminology used by the software.

For groups of small rank, starting with SL(2, R), we will analyze its
representations and their invariants using the software ' understanding
the parameters that define a representation, compute it's infinitesimal
character, character formula, composition series, the lowest K-Type, other
K-types, check for unitarity etc.

Abstract:
I will report on work in progress with Radhika Ganapathy. One wishes to
study irreducible `smooth' complex representations of symplectic and
(split) orthogonal groups over local function fields, i.e., fields of the
form F_q((t)). The theory of `close local fields' proposes to do this by
studying the representation theory of these groups over (varying) finite
extensions of Q_p. We will discuss an approach to using this philosophy to
study the local Langlands correspondence for these groups.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics

Math Dept Seminar

Title: Dynamics of Distal Group Actions

Speaker: Ridhdi Shah

Location: LH 1

Date: June 25, 2014

Time: 3-4 pm

Abstract: An automorphism T of a locally compact group is said to be
distal if the closure of the T-orbit of any nontrivial element stays away
from the identity. We discuss some properties of distal actions on groups.
We will also relate distal groups with behaviour of powers of
probability measures on it.

Title: Iwasawa theory and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture:

Abstract: The celebrated BSD conjecture predicts a deep and mysterious
relationship between the algebraic rank of an elliptic curve
defined over a number field and an arithmetic invariant arising
front he L-function of the elliptic curve. More amazingly, it
predicts an exact formula for the leading term of the L-function.
Iwasawa theory has proven to be an effective tool in trying to
explain the philosophy behind such a mysterious relationship and
also in establishing the conjecture in certain cases. We shall
outline this theory and discuss  its applications.

Title   : On applying the Deligne-Kazhdan philosophy to classical groups

Date    : 29th January, 2015 (Thursday)

Time    : 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
I will report on work in progress with Radhika Ganapathy. One wishes to
study irreducible `smooth' complex representations of symplectic and
(split) orthogonal groups over local function fields, i.e., fields of the
form F_q((t)). The theory of `close local fields' proposes to do this by
studying the representation theory of these groups over (varying) finite
extensions of Q_p. We will discuss an approach to using this philosophy
to study the local Langlands correspondence for these groups.

All are cordially invited!

Abstract:
Unlike integer factorization, a reducible holomorphic eta quotient may not
factorize uniquely as a product of irreducible holomorphic eta quotients.
But whenever such an eta quotient is reducible, the occurrence of a
certain type of factor could be observed: We conjecture that if a
holomorphic eta
quotient f of level M is reducible, then f has a factor of level M.  In
particular, it implies that rescalings and Atkin-Lehner involutions of
irreducible holomorphic eta quotients are irreducible. We prove a number
of results towards this conjecture:  For example, we show that a reducible
holomorphic eta quotient of level M always factorizes nontrivially at some
level N which is a multiple of M such that rad(N) = rad(M) and moreover, N
is bounded from above by an explicit function of M. This implies a new and
much faster algorithm to check the irreducibility of holomorphic eta
quotients.  In particular,  we show that our conjecture holds if M is a
prime power. We also show that the level of any factor of a holomorphic
eta quotient f of level M and weight k is bounded w.r.t. M and k. Further,
we show that there are only finitely many irreducible holomorphic eta
quotients of a given level and provide a bound on the weights of such eta
quotients. Finally, we give an example of an infinite family of
irreducible holomorphic eta quotients of prime power levels.

Title: AN INTRODUCTION TO ATLAS: BASIC BACKGROUND AND APPLICATIONS

Speaker: JONATHAN FERNANDES

Date: Aug 14, 2015

Time: 4pm

Location: LH-1

Abstract. Let G_R be the real points of a complex connected reductive al-
gebraic group G defined over R. The Atlas Software is a computational tool,
primarily designed to compute signatures of hermitian forms on hermitian
representations of G_R. The output of the software can be used to compute
a lot more than just Hermitian forms.

In this talk, we will introduce some basic terminology used by the software.

For groups of small rank, starting with SL(2, R), we will analyze its
representations and their invariants using the software ' understanding
the parameters that define a representation, compute it's infinitesimal
character, character formula, composition series, the lowest K-Type, other
K-types, check for unitarity etc.

Abstract:
One of the basic questions in harmonic analysis is to study the
decay properties of the Fourier transform of measures or
distributions supported on thin sets in $\R^n$. When the support
is a smooth enough manifold, an almost complete picture is
available. One of the early results in this direction is the
following: Let $f\in C_c^{\infty}(d\sigma)$, where
$d\sigma$ is the surface measure on the sphere
$S^{n-1}\subset\R^n$. Then

$$|\widehat{fd\sigma}(\xi)|\leq\ C\ (1+|\xi|)^{-\frac{n-1}{2}}.$$

It follows that $\widehat{fd\sigma}\in L^p(\R^n)$ for all
$p>2n/(n-1)$. This result can be extended to compactly
supported measure on $(n-1)$-dimensional manifolds with
appropriate assumptions on the curvature. Similar results are
known for measures supported in lower dimensional manifolds in
$\R^n$ under appropriate curvature conditions. However, the
picture for fractal measures is far from complete. This thesis is
a contribution to the study of asymptotic properties of the
Fourier transform of measures supported in sets of fractal
dimension $0<\alpha<n$ for $p\leq 2n/\alpha$.\\

In 2004, Agranovsky and Narayanan proved that if $\mu$ is a
measure supported in a $C^1$-manifold of dimension $d<n$, then
$\widehat{fd\mu}\notin L^p(\R^n)$ for $1\leq p\leq \frac{2n}{d}$. We
prove that the Fourier transform of a measure $\mu_E$ supported in
a set $E$ of fractal dimension $\alpha$ does not belong to
$L^p(\R^n)$ for $p\leq 2n/\alpha$. We also study $L^p$-asymptotics
of the Fourier transform of fractal measures $\mu_E$ under
appropriate conditions on $E$ and give quantitative versions of
the above statement by obtaining lower and upper bounds for the
following:
  $$\underset{L\rightarrow\infty}{\limsup} \frac{1}{L^k}
    \int_{|\xi|\leq L}|\wh{fd\mu_E}(\xi)|^pd\xi,$$
  $$\underset{L\rightarrow\infty}{\limsup} \frac{1}{L^k}
     \int_{L\leq |\xi|\leq 2L}|\wh{fd\mu_E}(\xi)|^pd\xi.$$

All are cordially invited!

Title   : On critical points of random polynomials and spectrum of certain
products of Ginibre matrices.

Date    : 24th July, 2015 (Friday)

Time    : 11:00 AM

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract: In the first part we study critical points of random
polynomials. We choose two deterministic sequences of complex numbers,
whose empirical measures converge to the same probability measure in
complex plane. We make a sequence of polynomials whose zeros are chosen
from either of sequences at random. We show that the limiting empirical
measure of zeros and critical points agree for these polynomials. As a
consequence we show that when we randomly perturb the zeros of a
deterministic sequence of polynomials, the limiting empirical measures of
zeros and critical points agree. This result can be interpreted as an
extension of earlier results where randomness is reduced. Pemantle and
Rivin initiated the study of critical points of random polynomials.
Kabluchko proved the result considering the zeros to be i.i.d. random
variables.

In the second part we deal with the spectrum of products of Ginibre
matrices. Exact eigenvalue density is known for a very few matrix
ensembles. For the known ones they often lead to determinantal point
process. Let X_1,X_2,...,X_k be i.i.d matrices of size nxn whose entries
are independent complex Gaussian random variables. We derive the
eigenvalue density for matrices of the form Y_1.Y_2....Y_n, where each
Y_i = X_i or (X_i)^{-1}. We show that the eigenvalues form a determinantal
point process. The case where k=2, Y_1=X_1,Y_2=X_2^{-1} was derived
earlier by Krishnapur. The case where Y_i =X_i for all i=1,2,...,n, was
derived by Akemann and Burda. These two known cases can be obtained as
special cases of our result.

Title   : Equivariant Cobordism Classes of Milnor Manifolds

Date    : 28th April, 2015 (Tuesday)

Time    : 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
Let G be a 2-group, and let Z(G) denote the equivariant cobordism
algebra of G-manifolds with finite stationary point sets.A cobordism class
in Z(G) is said to be indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the sum
of products of lower dimensional cobordism classes.Indecomposable classes
generate the cobordism algebra Z(G). We discuss a sufficient criteria for
indecomposability of cobordism classes.
Using the above mentioned criterion, we show that the classes of Milnor
manifolds (i.e., degree 1 hypersurfaces of the product of two real
projective spaces) give non-trivial, indecomposable elements in Z(G) in
degrees up to 2^n - 5.
This talk is based on joint work with Samik Basu and Goutam Mukherjee.

Title: Reflected Backward SDEs with General Jumps

Abstract: In the first part of this paper we give a solution for the
one-dimensional reflected backward
stochastic differential equation (BSDE for short) when the noise is driven
by a Brownian motion
and an independent Poisson random measure. The reflecting process is right
continuous with left
limits (RCLL for short) whose jumps are arbitrary. We first prove
existence and uniqueness of the
solution for a specific coefficient in using a method based on a
combination of penalization and the
Snell envelope theory. To show the general result we use a fixed point
argument in an appropriate
space. The second part of the paper is related to BSDEs with two
reflecting barriers. Once more we
prove existence and uniqueness of the solution of the BSDE.

Title   : Factorization of holomorphic eta quotients

Date    : 20th March, 2015 (Friday)

Time    : 2:00 p.m. - 3:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
Unlike integer factorization, a reducible holomorphic eta quotient may not
factorize uniquely as a product of irreducible holomorphic eta quotients.
But whenever such an eta quotient is reducible, the occurrence of a
certain type of factor could be observed: We conjecture that if a
holomorphic eta
quotient f of level M is reducible, then f has a factor of level M.  In
particular, it implies that rescalings and Atkin-Lehner involutions of
irreducible holomorphic eta quotients are irreducible. We prove a number
of results towards this conjecture:  For example, we show that a reducible
holomorphic eta quotient of level M always factorizes nontrivially at some
level N which is a multiple of M such that rad(N) = rad(M) and moreover, N
is bounded from above by an explicit function of M. This implies a new and
much faster algorithm to check the irreducibility of holomorphic eta
quotients.  In particular,  we show that our conjecture holds if M is a
prime power. We also show that the level of any factor of a holomorphic
eta quotient f of level M and weight k is bounded w.r.t. M and k. Further,
we show that there are only finitely many irreducible holomorphic eta
quotients of a given level and provide a bound on the weights of such eta
quotients. Finally, we give an example of an infinite family of
irreducible holomorphic eta quotients of prime power levels.

Title: Fast algorithms for data analysis and elliptic partial differential
equations

Speaker: Sivaram Ambikasaran (NYU)

Date: June 24

Time: 11-12

Location: LH1

Abstract: Large-dense matrices arise in numerous applications: boundary
integral formulation for elliptic partial differential equations,
covariance matrices in statistics, inverse problems, radial basis function
interpolation, multi frontal solvers for sparse linear systems, etc. As
the problem size increases, large memory requirements, scaling as O(N^2),
and extensive computational time to perform matrix algebra, scaling as
O(N^2) or O(N^3), make computations impractical. I will discuss some novel
methods for handling these computationally intense problems. In the first
half of the talk, I will discuss my contributions to some of the new
developments in handling large dense covariance matrices in the context of
computational statistics and Bayesian data assimilation. More
specifically, I will be discussing how fast dense linear algebra (O(N)
algorithms for inversion, determinant computation, symmetric
factorisation, etc.) enables us to handle large scale Gaussian processes,
thereby providing an attractive approach for big data applications. In the
second half of the talk, I will focus on a new algorithm termed Inverse
Fast Multipole Method, which permits solving singular integral equations
arising out of elliptic PDE's at a computational cost of O(N).

Speaker : Srikanth Iyer (IISc, Bangalore)

Title : Achieving positive information velocity in wireless networks

Date : 6th April, 2015 (Monday)

Time : 2:00 - 3:00 p.m.

Venue : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract: In wireless networks, where each node transmits independently of
other nodes in the network (the ALOHA protocol), the expected delay
experienced by a packet until it is successfully received at any other
node is known to be infinite for signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio
(SINR) model with node locations distributed according to a Poisson point
process. Consequently, the information velocity, defined as the limit of
the ratio of the distance to the destination and the time taken for a
packet to successfully reach the destination over multiple hops, is zero,
as the distance tends to infinity. A nearest neighbor distance based power
control policy is proposed to show that the expected delay required for a
packet to be successfully received at the nearest
neighbor can be made finite. Moreover, the information velocity is also
shown to be non-zero with the proposed power control policy. The condition
under which these results hold does not depend on the intensity of the
underlying Poisson point process.

Title : Normal convergence of geometric functionals of clustering point
processes

Date : 6th April, 2015 (Monday)

Time : 3:15 - 4:15 p.m.

Venue : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract: I shall describe a central limit theorem for geometric
functionals on point processes satisfying a "clustering condition".
Examples of geometric functionals of interest are subgraph and component
counts in a random geometric graph, intrinsic volumes of a Boolean model.
Non-trivial examples of point process that satisfy our requirements are
zeros of Gaussian analytic functions and determinantal point
processes. In some particular cases, I shall describe variance asymptotics
which are also necessary for the central limit theorem. This is a joint
work with Joseph Yukich and Bartek Blaszczyszyn.

Title: Dual pairs and intertwining distributions

Abstract: A reductive dual pair in the group Sp(W) of isometries of a
symplectic space W, over a local

field of characteristic not 2, is a pair of subgroups G, G0 of Sp(W) which
act reductively on

W and are centralizers of each others. In the 70ies, Roger Howe made (and
later proved over

the reals; for p-adics with p odd it was done by Jean-Loup Walsburger and
for p = 2 by Wee

Teck Gan this year) the conjecture that for any reductive dual pair G, G0

a one-to-one correspondence of irreducible admissible representations of
the lifts of G and G0

inside a certain two-fold covering group of Sp(W), the metaplectic group.
The main problem,

still open, is to understand this correspondence. Many different
approaches have been used

to describe Howe's correspondence by means of objects associated with
representations, such

as Langlands parameters, orbits, characters or infinitesimal characters.

The so-called intertwining distributions are special tempered
distributions on the symplectic

space W which are naturally linked to pairs of representations occurring
in Howe's corre-
spondence over the reals. They are a tool to understand this
correspondence at the level of

characters. We shall explain this in the case where the group G is
compact. This is a joint

work with Mark McKee and Tomasz Przebinda.

Title: Gohberg Lemma, Compactness and Essential Spectrum of Operators on
Compact Lie Groups

Speaker: Aparajita Dasgupta (EPFL, Lausanne)

Abstract: In this talk we prove a version of the Gohberg lemma on compact
Lie groups giving an estimate from below for the distance from a given
operator to the set of compact operators on compact Lie groups. As a
consequence, we prove several results on bounds for the essential spectrum
and a criterion for an operator to be compact. The conditions are given in
terms of the matrix-valued symbols of operators. (This is a joint work
with Professor Michael Ruzhansky.)

       BANGALORE PROBABILITY SEMINAR

Speaker : Srikanth Iyer (IISc, Bangalore)

Title   : Achieving positive information velocity in wireless networks

Date    : 6th April, 2015 (Monday)

Time    : 2:00 - 3:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract: In wireless networks, where each node transmits independently of
other nodes in the network (the ALOHA protocol), the expected delay
experienced by a packet until it is successfully received at any other
node is known to be infinite for signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio
(SINR) model with node locations distributed according to a Poisson point
process. Consequently, the information velocity, defined as the limit of
the ratio of the distance to the destination and the time taken for a
packet to successfully reach the destination over multiple hops, is zero,
as the distance tends to infinity. A nearest neighbor distance based power
control policy is proposed to show that the expected delay required for a
packet to be successfully received at the nearest
neighbor can be made finite. Moreover, the information velocity is also
shown to be non-zero with the proposed power control policy. The condition
under which these results hold does not depend on the intensity of the
underlying Poisson point process.

Title   : Normal convergence of geometric functionals of clustering point
processes

Date    : 6th April, 2015 (Monday)

Time    : 3:15 - 4:15 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract: I shall describe a central limit theorem for geometric
functionals on point processes satisfying a "clustering condition".
Examples of geometric functionals of interest are subgraph and component
counts in a random geometric graph, intrinsic volumes of a Boolean model.
Non-trivial examples of point process that satisfy our requirements are
zeros of Gaussian analytic functions and determinantal point
processes. In some particular cases, I shall describe variance asymptotics
which are also necessary for the central limit theorem. This is a joint
work with Joseph Yukich and Bartek Blaszczyszyn.

Abstract:
Farey-Ford Packings are a special case of more general circle packings
called Apollonian Circle Packings (ACP). These packings have some very
interesting properties, for exmaple, if any four mutually tangent circles
have integer curvatures, then so do all others in the packing. This has
led to many important problems like prime number theorem in this setting.
Kontorovich and Oh explore it from dynamics point of view whereas
Bourgain, Fuchs and Sarnak look at them more number theoretically. In this
talk, our focus will be on the specialized packings Farey-Ford Packings.
We consider some basic statistics associated to these circles and answer
some questions about their distributions and asymptotic behavior. One can
ask similar questions in the general setting for ACP, and if time permits,
we will discuss it in this talk. Some of this is joint work with Athreya,
Chaubey and Zaharescu.


All are cordially invited!

Abstract:  Abstract  : In this work, we study certain stability results

Separationproperties in
Banach Spaces leading to a discussion in the context of operator spaces.
In this  work, we
study certain stability results for Small Combination of  Slices Property
(SCSP) leading to a
discussion on SCSP in the context of operator spaces. SCSpoints were first
introduced as a
"slice generalisation" of the PC  (i.e. point ofcontinuity  points  for
which the identity mapping
from weak topology to normtopology is continuous.) It is known that X is
strongly regular
respectively X*is w*-strongly regular) if  and  only  if  every   non
empty  bounded convex  set
K in X ( respectively  K in X*) is contained in the norm closure (
respectively          w*-
closure)of SCS(K)( respectively w*-SCS(K)) i.e. the SCS points ( w*- SCS
points) of K.
Later, it was proved that a Banach space has Radon- Nikodym  Property
(RNP) if and only if
it is strongly regular and it has the Krein-Milamn  Property(KMP).
Subsequently, the concepts
of SCS points was used to investigate the structure of non-dentable closed
bounded convex
sets  in  Banach spaces. The "point version" of the result   was also
shown to be true .

                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Prof Carsten Carstensen
          Humboldt University, Berlin

Title   : Axioms of Adaptivity

Date    : 23rd February, 2015 (Monday)

Time    : 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
Four axioms (A1)--(A4) link estimators and distance functions on
a set of admissible refinements together and imply optimality of a
standard finite element routine on an abstract level with a loop: solve,
estimate, mark, and refine. The presentation provides proofs and examples
of the recent review due to  C. Carstensen, M. Feischl, M. Page, and D.
Praetorius: The axioms of adaptivity, Comput. Math. Appl. 67 (2014) 1195
--1253 and so discusses the current literature  on the mathematics of
adaptive finite element methods. The presentation concludes with an
overview over several applications of the set of axioms. If time permits,
some recent developments are discussed on ongoing joint work with Hella
Rabus on separate marking.


All are cordially invited!

Time    : 3:30 p.m. - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
In this talk, I will give a proof of Alexandrov's theorem on the Gauss
curvature prescription of Euclidean convex body. The proof is mainly based
on mass transport. In particular, it doesn't rely on pdes method nor
convex polyhedra theory. To proceed, I will discuss generalizations of
well-known results for the quadratic cost to the case of a cost function
which assumes infinite value.

Abstract:
Farey-Ford Packings are a special case of more general circle packings
called Apollonian Circle Packings (ACP). These packings have some very
interesting properties, for exmaple, if any four mutually tangent circles
have integer curvatures, then so do all others in the packing. This has
led to many important problems like prime number theorem in this setting.
Kontorovich and Oh explore it from dynamics point of view whereas
Bourgain, Fuchs and Sarnak look at them more number theoretically. In this
talk, our focus will be on the specialized packings Farey-Ford Packings.
We consider some basic statistics associated to these circles and answer
some questions about their distributions and asymptotic behavior. One can
ask similar questions in the general setting for ACP, and if time permits,
we will discuss it in this talk. Some of this is joint work with Athreya,
Chaubey and Zaharescu.


All are cordially invited!

Title   : Equivariant Cobordism Classes of Milnor Manifolds

Date    : 28th April, 2015 (Tuesday)

Time    : 3:30 p.m. - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
Let G be a 2-group, and let Z(G) denote the equivariant cobordism
algebra of G-manifolds with finite stationary point sets.A cobordism class
in Z(G) is said to be indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the sum
of products of lower dimensional cobordism classes.Indecomposable classes
generate the cobordism algebra Z(G). We discuss a sufficient criteria for
indecomposability of cobordism classes.
Using the above mentioned criterion, we show that the classes of Milnor
manifolds (i.e., degree 1 hypersurfaces of the product of two real
projective spaces) give non-trivial, indecomposable elements in Z(G) in
degrees up to 2^n - 5.
This talk is based on joint work with Samik Basu and Goutam Mukherjee.



All are cordially invited!

Title   : Dynamics of Distal Group Actions

Date    : June 25, 2014

Time    : 3:00-4:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall 1, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
An automorphism T of a locally compact group is said to be distal if the
closure of the T-orbit of any nontrivial element stays away from the
identity. We discuss some properties of distal actions on groups. We will
also relate distal groups with behaviour of powers of probability measures
on it.


                       All are welcome!

Title: A transference result between radial Fourier multipliers and zonal
multipliers on the unit sphere.

Speaker: Sriram Alladi

Date: 24-07-2014

Time: 4:00 pm

Location: LH-1

Abstract
A result of Coifman and Weiss asserts that for 1 < p < &#8734; results about
L^p zonal multipliers on the unit sphere can be transplanted to results
concerning L^p radial multipliers acting on radial functions in Euclidean
space. We will discuss a partial converse to this and a related result of
Igari. The proof makes use of a characterization of radial mutipliers by
Garrigos and Seeger.

Title: Localisation theorems for Bochner-Riesz means.

Abstract:- Define
$S_R^{\alpha}f:=\int_{\R^d}(1-\frac{|\xi|^2}{R^2})_{+}^{\alpha}\hat{f}(\xi)\exp^{i2\pi
x.\xi}d\xi,$ the Bochner Riesz means of order $\alpha\geq 0.$ Let $f\in
L^2(\R^d)$ and $f\eq 0$ in an open, bounded set $B.$ Its known that
$S_R^{\alpha}f goes to 0 a.e. in $B$ as $R\rightarrow\infty.$ We study the
pointwise convergence of Bochner Riesz means $S_{R}^{\alpha}f, \alpha>0$ as
$\R$\rightarrow \infty$
on sets of positive Hausdorff measure in $\R^d$ by making use of the decay
of the spherical means of Fourier Transform of fractal measures. We get an
improvement in the range of the Hausdorff dimension of the sets on which it
converges. When $0<\alpha<\frac{d-1}{4}$ we get the best possible result in
$\R^2$ and in higher dimensions we improve the result by L.Colzani, G.
Gigante and A. Vargas. Stein's interpolation theorem also gives us  the
corresponding
result for $f\in L^p(\R^d), 1<p<2.$

Title: Operads: An Introduction.

Abstract:   An operad is an algebraic device which encodes a type of
algebra. The
classical types of algebras, ie. associative, commutative and Lie
algebras give the first examples of algebraic operads. Operadic point
of view has several advantages. Firstly, many results known for
classical algebras, when written out in operadic language, can be
applied to other types of algebras. Secondly, operadic language
simplifies the statements and proofs. Thirdly, even for classical
cases, operad theory has provided new results. We start with several
equivalent definitions, together with examples, and  few basic
properties.

Dear all,

                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Prof. Dr. Martin Kreuzer
          University of Passau, Germany

Title   : Computational Aspects of Burnside Algebras I

Date    : 25th February, 2015 (Wednesday)

Time    : 2:00 p.m. - 3:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
In this two-part talk, we reconsider Burnside algebras,
a classical tool in the theory of finite groups, from a computational
perspective. Using modern computer algebra systems, many of the results
about these rings that were proved in the second half of the last century
can be transformed into effective algorithms.

After recalling the definition and basic properties of the Bunside ring of
a finite group, we show how to compute an explicit presentation on terms
of generators and relations, how to determine the prime ideal spectrum and
its connected components, and how to relate the Burnside ring to its
normalization by computing its quasi-idempotents.

In the latter parts of the lectures we introduce explicit methods
for computing classical maps between the Burnside rings of related groups
such as the restriction and inflation maps. All algorithms will be
accompanied by actual computations of concrete examples.


All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics

                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Prof Carsten Carstensen
          Humboldt University, Berlin

Title   : Axioms of Adaptivity

Date    : 23rd February, 2015 (Monday)

Time    : 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
Four axioms (A1)--(A4) link estimators and distance functions on
a set of admissible refinements together and imply optimality of a
standard finite element routine on an abstract level with a loop: solve,
estimate, mark, and refine. The presentation provides proofs and examples
of the recent review due to  C. Carstensen, M. Feischl, M. Page, and D.
Praetorius: The axioms of adaptivity, Comput. Math. Appl. 67 (2014) 1195
--1253 and so discusses the current literature  on the mathematics of
adaptive finite element methods. The presentation concludes with an
overview over several applications of the set of axioms. If time permits,
some recent developments are discussed on ongoing joint work with Hella
Rabus on separate marking.


All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics

Title   : Equivariant Cobordism Classes of Milnor Manifolds

Date    : 28th April, 2015 (Tuesday)

Time    : 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
Let G be a 2-group, and let Z(G) denote the equivariant cobordism
algebra of G-manifolds with finite stationary point sets.A cobordism class
in Z(G) is said to be indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the sum
of products of lower dimensional cobordism classes.Indecomposable classes
generate the cobordism algebra Z(G). We discuss a sufficient criteria for
indecomposability of cobordism classes.
Using the above mentioned criterion, we show that the classes of Milnor
manifolds (i.e., degree 1 hypersurfaces of the product of two real
projective spaces) give non-trivial, indecomposable elements in Z(G) in
degrees up to 2^n - 5.
This talk is based on joint work with Samik Basu and Goutam Mukherjee.



All are cordially invited!

Chairman,

Title: Gohberg Lemma, Compactness and Essential Spectrum of Operators on
Compact Lie Groups

Speaker: Aparajita Dasgupta (EPFL, Lausanne)

Abstract: In this talk we prove a version of the Gohberg lemma on compact
Lie groups giving an estimate from below for the distance from a given
operator to the set of compact operators on compact Lie groups. As a
consequence, we prove several results on bounds for the essential spectrum
and a criterion for an operator to be compact. The conditions are given in
terms of the matrix-valued symbols of operators. (This is a joint work
with Professor Michael Ruzhansky.)

Title: Non-vanishing of Dirichlet L-functions in Galois orbits

Speaker : Rizwanur Khan

Time: June 12, 2015 ( 3-4 PM)

Place : LH 1

Abstract: A well known result of Iwaniec and Sarnak states that for at
least one third of the primitive Dirichlet characters modulo q (where q is
any sufficiently large integer), the associated L-functions do not vanish
at the central point. When q is a large power of a fixed prime, we prove
the same proportion when we restrict to characters of any given order. The
set of primitive Dirichlet characters modulo q of a given order can be
described as an orbit under the action of a Galois group.

Title: Finite configurations in sparse sets

Location: LH-1

Time: 11:30 AM

Abstract: A problem of interest in geometric measure theory both in
discrete and continuous settings is the identification of algebraic and
geometric patterns in thin sets. The first two lectures will be a survey of
the literature on pattern recognition in sparse sets, with a greater
emphasis on continuum problems. The second two contain an exposition of
recent work, joint in part with Vincent Chan, Kevin Henriot and Izabella
Laba on the existence of linear and polynomial configurations in
multi-dimensional Lebesgue-null sets satisfying appropriate Hausdorff and
Fourier dimensionality conditions.

                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Jerome Bertrand
          Universit' Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France

Title   : Prescribing Gauss curvature using mass transport

Date    : 25th February, 2015 (Wednesday)

Time    : 3:30 p.m. - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
In this talk, I will give a proof of Alexandrov's theorem on the Gauss
curvature prescription of Euclidean convex body. The proof is mainly based
on mass transport. In particular, it doesn't rely on pdes method nor
convex polyhedra theory. To proceed, I will discuss generalizations of
well-known results for the quadratic cost to the case of a cost function
which assumes infinite value.


All are cordially invited!

Abstract:
Farey-Ford Packings are a special case of more general circle packings
called Apollonian Circle Packings (ACP). These packings have some very
interesting properties, for exmaple, if any four mutually tangent circles
have integer curvatures, then so do all others in the packing. This has
led to many important problems like prime number theorem in this setting.
Kontorovich and Oh explore it from dynamics point of view whereas
Bourgain, Fuchs and Sarnak look at them more number theoretically. In this
talk, our focus will be on the specialized packings Farey-Ford Packings.
We consider some basic statistics associated to these circles and answer
some questions about their distributions and asymptotic behavior. One can
ask similar questions in the general setting for ACP, and if time permits,
we will discuss it in this talk. Some of this is joint work with Athreya,
Chaubey and Zaharescu.

Abstract:
Let G be a 2-group, and let Z(G) denote the equivariant cobordism
algebra of G-manifolds with finite stationary point sets.A cobordism class
in Z(G) is said to be indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the sum of
products of lower dimensional cobordism classes.Indecomposable classes
generate the cobordism algebra Z(G). We discuss a sufficient criteria for
indecomposability of cobordism classes.
Using the above mentioned criterion, we show that the classes of Milnor
manifolds (i.e., degree 1 hypersurfaces of the product of two real
projective spaces) give non-trivial, indecomposable elements in Z(G) in
degrees up to 2^n - 5.
This talk is based on joint work with Samik Basu and Goutam Mukherjee.

Speaker : Prof. Dr. Martin Kreuzer

Title   : Computational Aspects of Bunside Algebras I

Date    : 25th February, 2015 (Wednesday)

Time    : 2:00 p.m. - 3:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
In this two-part talk, we reconsider Burnside algebras,
a classical tool in the theory of finite groups, from a computational
perspective. Using modern computer algebra systems, many of the results
about these rings that were proved in the second half of the last century
can be transformed into effective algorithms.

After recalling the definition and basic properties of the Bunside
ring of a finite group, we show how to compute an explicit presentation on
terms of generators and relations, how to determine the prime ideal
spectrum and its connected components, and how to relate the Burnside ring
to its normalization by computing its quasi-idempotents.

In the latter parts of the lectures we introduce explicit methods
for computing classical maps between the Burnside rings of related groups
such as the restriction and inflation maps. All algorithms will be
accompanied by actual computations of concrete examples.


All are cordially invited!

Title: Some computational and analytic aspects of Chern-Weil forms

Abstract: This talk will focus on two aspects of vector bundles. One is
the calculation and application of certain characteristic and secondary
characteristic forms (i.e. Chern, Chern-Simons, and Bott-Chern forms).
This part is joint work with Leon Takhtajan and Indranil Biswas. The
second is to study certain fully nonlinear PDE akin to the Monge-Amp\'ere
equation arising from these differential geometric objects. An existence
result or two will be presented along with the difficulties involved in
the PDE. Moreover, other areas of geometry and physics from which the same
PDE arise will be pointed out.

perspective. Using modern computer algebra systems, many of the results
about these rings that were proved in the second half of the last century
can be transformed into effective algorithms.

After recalling the definition and basic properties of the Bunside ring of
a finite group, we show how to compute an explicit presentation on terms
of generators and relations, how to determine the prime ideal spectrum and
its connected components, and how to relate the Burnside ring to its
normalization by computing its quasi-idempotents.

In the latter parts of the lectures we introduce explicit methods
for computing classical maps between the Burnside rings of related groups
such as the restriction and inflation maps. All algorithms will be
accompanied by actual computations of concrete examples.


All are cordially invited!

Title: Non-vanishing of Dirichlet L-functions in Galois orbits

Speaker : Rizwanur Khan

Time: June 19, 2015 ( 3-4 PM)

Place : LH 1

Abstract: A well known result of Iwaniec and Sarnak states that for at
least one third of the primitive Dirichlet characters modulo q (where q is
any sufficiently large integer), the associated L-functions do not vanish
at the central point. When q is a large power of a fixed prime, we prove
the same proportion when we restrict to characters of any given order. The
set of primitive Dirichlet characters modulo q of a given order can be
described as an orbit under the action of a Galois group.

Title   : Weighted norm inequalities for Weyl multipliers and Hermite

Time    : 2:30pm - 3:30pm

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
In this talk we deal with two problems in harmonic analysis.
In the first problem we discuss weighted norm inequalities for Weyl
multipliers satisfying Mauceri's condition. As an application, we prove
certain multiplier theorems on the Heisenberg group and also show in the
context of a theorem of Weis on operator valued Fourier multipliers that
the R-boundedness of the derivative of the multiplier is not necessary
for the boundedness of the multiplier transform.
In the second problem we deal with a variation of a theorem of Mauceri
concerning the L^p boundedness of operators M which are known to be
bounded on L^2: We obtain sufficient conditions on the kernel of the
operator M so that it satisfies weighted L^p estimates. As an application
we prove L^p boundedness of Hermite pseudo-multipliers.

All are cordially invited!

Title: Random Matrices, Numerical Computation, and Applications

Date: June 3

Time: 4-5 pm

Location: LH1

Speaker: Alan Edelman (MIT)

Abstract: This talk is about random matrix theory.  Linear Algebra and
maybe a little probability are the only prerequisites.  Random matrix
theory is now finding many applications.  Many more applications remain to
be found. It is truly "matrix statistics," when traditional statistics has
been primarily "scalar" and "vector" statistics.  The math is so much
richer, and the applications to computational finance, HIV research, the
Riemann Zeta Function, and crystal growth, to name a few, show how
important this area is.  I will show some of these applications, and
invite you to find some of your own.

  For me, there has been an exciting lesson.  It has to do with the
interplay between mathematics and computation.   The computer plays many
roles in mathematics. It provides experimental data to suggest, confirm, or
discard potential theorems.  It provides simulations to bring cold theorems
to life.  It illustrates in detail the exact nature
of particular solutions.

Julia is emerging as a major computational language in many areas
including random matrix theory. This talk will show why.

Title:  Koszul duality theory for algebras.

Abstract:  Koszul duality theory is a homological method aiming at
constructing
an explicit quasi-free resolution for quadratic algebras. We introduce
the concepts of bar (and cobar) construction for a quadratic algebra
(and coalgebra) and provide a quasi-free resolution for quadratic
algebras, under certain assumptions.

Title: Finite configurations in sparse sets

Location: LH-1

Abstract: A problem of interest in geometric measure theory both in
discrete and continuous settings is the identification of algebraic and
geometric patterns in thin sets. The first two lectures will be a survey of
the literature on pattern recognition in sparse sets, with a greater
emphasis on continuum problems. The second two contain an exposition of
recent work, joint in part with Vincent Chan, Kevin Henriot and Izabella
Laba on the existence of linear and polynomial configurations in
multi-dimensional Lebesgue-null sets satisfying appropriate Hausdorff and
Fourier dimensionality conditions.

Title: Electrostatic skeletons

Speaker: Koushik Ramachandran (ISI, Bangalore)

Date: June 24

Time and venue: 3-4 PM, LH-1, department of mathematics

Abstract: Let P be the equilibrium potential of a compact set K in R^n. An
electrostatic skeleton of K is a positive measure ' such that the closed
support S of ' has connected complement and empty interior, and the
Newtonian (or logarithmic, when n = 2) potential of ' is equal to P
near infinity. We prove the existence and uniqueness of an electrostatic
skeleton for any simplex.

Title: On ideals and associated notions of convergence

Abstract : In this talk we discuss how the notion of usual convergence is
extended using the notion of
ideals and the importance of P-ideals. We then show how ideals can be
generated and in particular
how the P ideals can be generated by matrices other than regular
summability matrix

Title :Weighted norm inequalities for rough singular integral operators

Abstract : The study of weighted inequalities in Classical Harmonic
Analysis started in 70's, when B. Muckenhoupt characterised in 1972 the
weights $w$ for which the Hardy--Littlewood maximal function is bounded in
$L^p(w)$. At that time the question about how the operator depended on the
constant associated with $w$, which we denote by $[w]_{A_p}$, was not
considered (i.e., \textit{quantitative estimates}) were not investigated.

>From the beginning of 2000's, a great activity has been carried out in
order to obtain the sharp dependence for singular integral operators,
reaching the solution of the so-called $A_2$ conjecture by T. P.
H\"ytonen.

In this talk we consider operators with homogeneous singular kernels, on
which we assume smoothness conditions that are weaker than the standard
ones (this is why they are called rough). The first qualitative weighted
estimates are due to J. Duoandikoetxea and J. L. Rubio de Francia. For the
norm of these operators in the space $L^2(w)$ we obtain a quantitative
estimate which is quadratic in the constant $[w]_{A_2}$.

The results are based on a classical decomposition of the rough operators
as a sum of other operators with a smoother kernel, for which a
quantitative reelaboration of a dyadic decomposition proposed by M. T.
Lacey is applied.

We will overview as well the most recent advances, mainly associated with
quantitative estimates for these rough singular integrals. In particular,
Coifman--Fefferman type inequalities (which are new even in their
qualitative version), weighted $A_p-A_{\infty}$ inequalities and a
quantitative version of weak $(1,1)$ estimates will be shown.

Title: Riemann-Roch, Alexander Duality and Free Resolutions.
>
>
> Abstract: The Riemann-Roch theorem is fundamental to algebraic geometry.
> In 2006, Baker and Norine discovered an analogue of the Riemann-Roch
> theorem for graphs. In fact, this theorem is not a mere analogue but has
> concrete relations with its algebro-geometric counterpart. Since its
> conception this topic has been explored in different directions, two
> significant directions are i. Connections to topics in discrete geometry
> and commutative algebra ii. As a tool to studying linear series on
> algebraic curves. We will provide a glimpse of these developments. Topics
> in commutative algebra such as Alexander duality and minimal free
> resolutions will make an appearance.  This talk is based on my
> dissertation and joint work with i. Bernd Sturmfels, ii. Frank-Olaf
> Schreyer and John Wilmes and iii. an ongoing work with Alex Fink.

Title: When is $R[\theta]$  integrally closed?

Speaker: Prof Sudesh Kaur Khanduja

Affiliation: IISER, Mohali

Location : LH-1

Time : 11 AM

Abstract: Let $R$ be an integrally closed domain with quotient field $K$
and $\theta$ be an element of an  integral domain containing $R$ with
$\theta$  integral over $R$ and  $F(x)$ be the minimal polynomial of
$\theta$ over $K$. We shall discuss some necessary and sufficient
conditions to be  satisfied by $F(x)$ so that $R[\theta]$  is integrally
closed. We shall also give applications of the results for algebraic
number fields to have a power basis.

Title: Risk-Sensitive Ergodic Control of Continuous Time Markov Processes
With Denumerable State Space

Abstract:  We study risk-sensitive control problem with controlled
continuous time Markov chain state dynamics. Using multiplicative dynamic
programming principle, we prove the existence and a characterization of
optimal risk-sensitive control under geometric ergodicity of the state
dynamics along with a smallness condition on the running cost.

Title: Exploring parameterised complexity in computational topology

Speaker: Benjamin A. Burton, The University of Queensland, Australia

Date: Nov 12

Time : 4:00 pm

Location: LH 1

Abstract: Exact computation with knots and 3-manifolds is challenging -
many fundamental
problems are decidable but enormously complex, and many major algorithms
have never
been implemented.  Even "simple" problems, such as unknot recognition
(testing whether a
loop of string is knotted), or 3-sphere recognition (testing whether a
triangulated 3-manifold is
topologically trivial), have best-known algorithms that are worst-case
exponential time.

In practice, however, modern software packages can solve many complex
topological
problems that "should" be intractable.  In this talk we discuss how
parameterised complexity
is emerging as a framework for understanding this surprising behaviour.
We also discuss
the rise of parameterised complexity as a practical tool for designing
topological algorithms,
and we discuss the interplay between topology, graph theory and logic that
makes this
possible.

Title: Multiobjective optimisation and tropical geometry


Abstract:
Multiobjective optimisation involves optimising several quantities, such
as time and money,
simultaneously.  The result is a polyhedral frontier of "best possible"
solutions, which cannot
improve one quantity without a trade-off against another.  For linear
programming, this
frontier can be generated using Benson's outer approximation algorithm,
which uses a
sequence of scalarisations (single-objective optimisations), combined with
classical
algorithms from polytope theory.

If we generalise to integer programming, then things become significantly
more complex.
The main problem is the loss of convexity - the frontier of best possible
solutions no longer
has a polyhedral description.  In this talk we show how to overcome this
problem using
tropical geometry, which replaces plus and times with the operations max
and plus.  The
optimal frontier can then be described in terms of tropical polyhedra, and
can be generated
using an analogous algorithm that combines integer scalarisations with
tropical polyhedral
algorithms.  As a corollary, we obtain a new upper bound on the number of
scalarisations
required to find all optimal solutions.

This is joint work with Michael Joswig.

Title: "Simultaneous Similarity Classes of tuples of Commuting matrices."

Speaker: Uday Bhaskar (IMSc, Chennai)

Date : Oct 7

Time : 2 pm

Location: LH-1


Abstract: The enumeration of isomorphism classes of modules of a
polynomial algebra in several variables over a finite field is the same as
the classifi cation of commuting tuples of matrices over a finite field up
to simultaneous similarity. Let C_{n,k}(q) denote the number of
isomorphism classes of n-dimensional Fq[x1,...,xk]-modules. The generating
function in k of the C_{n,k}(q) is a rational function. The computation of
this was done explicitly for n <= 4. I shall give a summary of my recently
published work on this study of the C_{n,k}(q)s for n <= 2.

Title: Rank-level duality of Conformal Blocks

Abstract: Classical invariants for representations of one Lie group can
often be related to invariants of some other Lie group. Physics suggests
that the right objects to consider for these questions are certain
refinements of classical invariants known as conformal blocks. Conformal
blocks appear in algebraic geometry as spaces of global sections of line
bundles on the moduli stack of parabolic bundles on a smooth curve.
Rank-level duality connects a conformal block associated to one Lie
algebra to a conformal block for a different Lie algebra.

In this talk, we will first discuss  rank-level duality for the pair
orthogonal and spin groups on the projective line and then for the pair
(G_2, F_4) over a smooth curve of genus g. If time permits, we will
discuss  rank-level duality for odd orthogonal groups over curves of
positive genus.  The later is joint with Richard Wentworth.

Title: Algorithms and complexity for Turaev-Viro invariants

Speaker: Jonathan Spreer, The University of Queensland, Australia

Date: Nov 13

Time: 4 pm

Location: LH-1

Abstract: The Turaev-Viro invariants are a powerful family of topological
invariants
for distinguishing between different 3-manifolds. They are invaluable for
mathematical software, but current algorithms to compute them require
exponential
time. I will discuss this family of invariants, and present an explicit
fixed-parameter
tractable algorithm for arbitrary r which is practical---and indeed
preferable---to the
prior state of the art for real computation.

Title/Abstract:  Strong pseudoconvexity in Banach spaces and applications

Date: 19th Feb.

Time/Venue: 3 - 4pm

Location: LH 3

Abstract: Having been unclear how to widely define strong (or strict)
pseudoconvexity in the infinite-dimensional context, we compared the
concept in the smooth-boundary case with strict convexity. As a result, w=
e
accomplished establishing definitions of local uniform pseudoconvexity,
uniform pseudoconvexity and strict pseudoconvexity for open and bounded
subsets of a Banach space. We will see examples of Banach spaces with
uniformly pseudoconvex unit ball, as well as examples of Banach spaces
whose unit ball is not even strictly pseudoconvex. As an application of
the techniques developed, we show that in finite dimension the concept of
strict plurisubharmonicity coincides with strict plurisubharmonicity
in distribution.

Title: Title: Landstad-Vaes theory for locally compact quantum groups

Abstract: In the seventies of last century, Magnus Landstad characterised
the coefficient C*-algebra
inside the multiplier algebra of a given crossed product C*-algebra
subject to an action of an Abelian locally compact group G. In 2005,
Stefaan Vaes extended the Landstad theory for "regular locally compact
quantum groups". He gave strong indications that this is not possible for
non-regular groups. In this talk I shall explain how Landstad-Vaes theory
extends for non-regular groups. To this end we have to consider not
necessary continuous, but measurable, actions of locally compact quantum
groups. For regular locally compact quantum groups any measurable action
is continuous, so our theory contains that of Landstad-Vaes. This is a
joint work with Stanislaw Lech Woronowicz.

Title: Iwasawa theory and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture:

Abstract: The celebrated BSD conjecture predicts a deep and mysterious
relationship between the algebraic rank of an elliptic curve
defined over a number field and an arithmetic invariant arising
front he L-function of the elliptic curve. More amazingly, it
predicts an exact formula for the leading term of the L-function.
Iwasawa theory has proven to be an effective tool in trying to
explain the philosophy behind such a mysterious relationship and
also in establishing the conjecture in certain cases. We shall
outline this theory and discuss  its applications.

Title: Homological Algebra of Ideals Related to Finite Simple Graphs.

Date: December 27, 2016

Time : 3 pm

Location : LH-1


Abstract: Given any finite simple graph G one can naturally associate two
ideals,
namely the edge ideal I(G) and the binomial edge ideal J_G in suitable
polynomial
rings. In this talk we shall discuss the interplay between combinatorics
of the graph
and depth and regularity of I(G), J_G and their powers. Some recent
progress and
some open problems will be discussed.

> Title: Asymptotically accurate and stable Runge-Kutta schemes for the
> wave equation system in the low Mach Number limit.

Abstract: We
> consider a wave equation system with advection as a simple linearised
> model of the compressible Euler equation of gas dynamics. It is well
> known that the solutions of the compressible Euler equations in a
> low-mach number regime are good approximations of the solutions of the
> incompressible Euler equations. Due to this asymptotic convergence,
> numerical schemes designed only for the compressible equations suffer
> from several pathologies: reduction of order, lack of stability,
> inconsistency etc. In the present work, we consider a framework for

Title: " Existence of Nash equilibrium for
chance-constrained games"

Abstract:
We consider an n-player strategic game with finite action sets. The payoffs
of each player are random variables. We assume that each player uses a
satisficing payoff criterion defined by a chance-constraint, i.e., players
face a chance-constrained game. We consider the cases where payoffs follow
normal and elliptically symmetric distributions. For both cases we show
that there always exists a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium of corresponding
chance-constrained game.

Title: Finite point configurations

Abstract:
As big data sets have become more common, there has been significant
interest in finding and understanding patterns in them. One example of a
simple pattern is the distance between data points, which can be thought of
as a 2-point configuration. Two classic questions, the Erdos distinct
distance problem, which asks about the least number of distinct distances
determined by N points in the plane, and its continuous analog, the
Falconer distance problem, explore that simple pattern. Questions similar
to the Erdos distinct distance problem and the Falconer distance problem
can also be posed for more complicated patterns such as triangles, which
can be viewed as 3-point configurations. In this talk I will present recent
Falconer type theorems, established by myself and my collaborators, for a
wide class of finite point configurations in any dimension. The techniques
we used come from analysis and geometric measure theory, and the key step
was to obtain bounds on multilinear analogues of generalized Radon
transforms.

Title: Iwasawa theory and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture:

Abstract: The celebrated BSD conjecture predicts a deep and mysterious
relationship between the algebraic rank of an elliptic curve
defined over a number field and an arithmetic invariant arising
front he L-function of the elliptic curve. More amazingly, it
predicts an exact formula for the leading term of the L-function.
Iwasawa theory has proven to be an effective tool in trying to
explain the philosophy behind such a mysterious relationship and
also in establishing the conjecture in certain cases. We shall
outline this theory and discuss  its applications.

Title/Abstract:  Strong pseudoconvexity in Banach spaces and applications

Date: 19th Feb.

Time/Venue: 3 - 4pm

Location: LH 3

Abstract: Having been unclear how to widely define strong (or strict)
pseudoconvexity in the infinite-dimensional context, we compared the
concept in the smooth-boundary case with strict convexity. As a result, w=
e
accomplished establishing definitions of local uniform pseudoconvexity,
uniform pseudoconvexity and strict pseudoconvexity for open and bounded
subsets of a Banach space. We will see examples of Banach spaces with
uniformly pseudoconvex unit ball, as well as examples of Banach spaces
whose unit ball is not even strictly pseudoconvex. As an application of
the techniques developed, we show that in finite dimension the concept of
strict plurisubharmonicity coincides with strict plurisubharmonicity
in distribution.

Title: Algebraic K and L-theory of groups acting on trees

Abstract: The Farrell-Jones Isomorphism conjecture gives a single
statement to understand many standard conjectures in Topology and Algebra=
.
We will discuss understanding K and L-theory of groups acting on trees
from the vertex stabilizers of the action, in the context of Isomorphism
conjecture.

Title: The isomorphism conjecture for Artin groups

Abstract: We will prove the Isomorphism conjecture for a class of Artin
groups and calculate the surgery L-groups of the corresponding pure Artin
groups.

Title: Exploring parameterised complexity in computational topology

Speaker: Benjamin A. Burton, The University of Queensland, Australia

Date: Nov 12

Time : 4:00 pm

Location: LH 1

Abstract: Exact computation with knots and 3-manifolds is challenging -
many fundamental
problems are decidable but enormously complex, and many major algorithms
have never
been implemented.  Even "simple" problems, such as unknot recognition
(testing whether a
loop of string is knotted), or 3-sphere recognition (testing whether a
triangulated 3-manifold is
topologically trivial), have best-known algorithms that are worst-case
exponential time.

In practice, however, modern software packages can solve many complex
topological
problems that "should" be intractable.  In this talk we discuss how
parameterised complexity
is emerging as a framework for understanding this surprising behaviour.
We also discuss
the rise of parameterised complexity as a practical tool for designing
topological algorithms,
and we discuss the interplay between topology, graph theory and logic that
makes this
possible.

Title: Resonances for the Laplacian on Riemannian symmetric spaces of the
noncompact type: the rank two case

Speaker: Angela Pasquale

Date: Aug 4, 2016

Time: 4 pm

Location: LH-1


Abstract:
Let $\Delta$ be the Laplacian on a Riemannian symmetric space $X=G/K$ of
the noncompact type and let
$\sigma(\Delta)\subseteq \mathbb{C}$ denote its spectrum. The resolvent
$(\Delta-z)^{-1}$ is a holomorphic function
on $\mathbb{C} \setminus \sigma(\Delta)$, with values in the space of
bounded operators on $L^2(X)$.
If we view it as a function with values in $\Hom(C_c^\infty(X),
C_c^\infty(X)^*)$, then it often
admits a meromorphic continuation beyond $\mathbb{C} \setminus
\sigma(\Delta)$.
We study this meromorphic continuation as a map defined on a Riemann
surface above
$\mathbb{C} \setminus \sigma(\Delta)$. The poles of
the meromorphically extended resolvent are called resonances. The image of
the residue operator
at a resonance is a $G$-module. The main problems are the existence and
the localization of the
resonances as well as the study of the (spherical) representations of $G$
so obtained.
In this talk, based on joint works with Joachim Hilgert and Tomasz Przebinda,
we will describe a variety of different situations occurring in the rank
two case.

Title: Algorithms and complexity for Turaev-Viro invariants

Speaker: Jonathan Spreer, The University of Queensland, Australia

Date: Nov 13

Time: 4 pm

Location: LH-1

Abstract: The Turaev-Viro invariants are a powerful family of topological
invariants
for distinguishing between different 3-manifolds. They are invaluable for
mathematical software, but current algorithms to compute them require
exponential
time. I will discuss this family of invariants, and present an explicit
fixed-parameter
tractable algorithm for arbitrary r which is practical---and indeed
preferable---to the
prior state of the art for real computation.

Title : A quantitative form of Schoenberg's theorem in fixed dimension
(Joint work with D. Guillot, A. Khare and M. Putinar)

Abstract : The Hadamard product of two matrices is formed by multiplying
corresponding entries, and the Schur product theorem states that
this operation preserves positive semidefiniteness.

It follows immediately that every analytic function with non-negative
Maclaurin coefficients, when applied entrywise, preserves positive
semidefiniteness for matrices of any order. The converse is due to
Schoenberg: a function which preserves positive semidefiniteness for
matrices of arbitrary order is necessarily analytic and has non-negative
Maclaurin coefficients.

For matrices of fixed order, the situation is more interesting. This talk
will present recent work which shows the existence of polynomials with
negative leading term which preserve positive semidefiniteness, and
characterises precisely how large this term may be.

Title: Twin Primes

Speaker: M. Ram Murty, Queen's University, Kingston, Canada

Date: Jan 4, 2016

Time: 4pm

Location: LH-1

Abstract: There is a folklore conjecture that there are infinitely
many primes p such that p+2 is also prime.
This conjecture is still open.  However, in the last two years,
spectacular progress has been made to show that there are
infinitely many primes p such that p+h is also prime with
1< h < 247.  We will discuss the history of this problem
and explain the new advances in sieve theory that have led
to these remarkable results.  We will also highlight what we may
expect in the future.

Title: Iwasawa theory and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture:

Abstract: The celebrated BSD conjecture predicts a deep and mysterious
relationship between the algebraic rank of an elliptic curve
defined over a number field and an arithmetic invariant arising
front he L-function of the elliptic curve. More amazingly, it
predicts an exact formula for the leading term of the L-function.
Iwasawa theory has proven to be an effective tool in trying to
explain the philosophy behind such a mysterious relationship and
also in establishing the conjecture in certain cases. We shall
outline this theory and discuss  its applications.

Title: Hecke algebras and the Langlands program

Abstract: Given an irreducible polynomial f(x) with integer coefficients
and a prime number p, one wishes to determine whether f(x) is a product of
distinct linear factors modulo p. When f(x) is a solvable polynomial, this
question is satisfactorily answered by the Class Field Theory. Attempts to
find a non-abelian Class Field Theory lead to the development of an area
of mathematics called the Langlands program.
The Langlands program, roughly speaking, predicts a natural correspondence
between the finite dimensional complex representations of the Galois group
of a local or a number field and the infinite dimensional representations
of real, p-adic and adelic reductive groups. I will give an outline of the
statement of the local Langlands correspondence. I will then briefly talk
about two of the main approaches towards the Langlands program - the type
theoretic approach relying on the theory of types developed by
Bushnell-Kutzko and others; and the endoscopic approach relying on the
trace formula and endoscopy. I will then state a couple of my results
involving these two approaches.

Title: Tropical Algebraic Geometry: an Introduction.


Abstract:  We start with a gentle introduction to tropical algebraic
geometry.  We then focus on the tropical lifting problem and discuss
recent progress. Tropical analogues of graph curves play an important role
in this study. This talk will be accessible to the general mathematical
audience.

Title: Voevodsky's smash nilpotence conjecture

Abstract: Voevodsky's conjecture states that numerical and smash
equivalence coincide for algebraic cycles. I shall explain the conjecture
in more detail and talk about some of the examples for which this
conjecture is known.

Title: Siegel-Veech transforms are in L2

Abstract: Let H denote a connected component of a stratum of translation
surfaces. We show that the Siegel-Veech transform of a bounded compactly
supported function on R2 is in L2(H,&#956;), where &#956; is the
Masur-Veech measure on H, and give applications to bounding error terms
for counting problems for saddle connections. We will review classical
results in the Geometry of Numbers which anticipate this result. This is
joint work with Yitwah Cheung and Howard Masur.

Title: Torelli theorem for the parabolic Deligne-Hitchin moduli space

 Abstract: The Deligne-Hitchin moduli space is a partial compactification
 of the moduli space of $\lambda$-connections. It includes as closed
 subvarieties the moduli spaces of Hitchin bundles ($\lambda=0$) and of
 holomorphic connections ($\lambda=1$), exhibiting the later as a
 deformation of the former. We show a Torelli theorem for a parabolic
version of this moduli space (joint work with David Alfaya). I will try to
make the talk accessible to a wide mathematical audience.

Title: Flow Invariance Preserving Feedback Controllers for Sabra Shell
Model of Turbulence

Abstract:

In this talk, I would continue dealing with Sabra shell model of
Turbulence and study one of the important questions for fluid flow
problems namely, finding controls which are capable of preserving the
invariant quantities of the flow.   Controls are designed in the feedback
form such that resultant controlled flow will preserve certain physical
properties of the state such as enstrophy, helicity. We use the theory of
nonlinear semigroups and represent the feedback control as a multi-valued
feedback term which lies in the normal cone of the convex constraint space
under consideration.

Title: Detecting free splittings

Abstract: The goal of this talk is to present an algorithm which takes a
compact square complex belonging to a special class as input and decides
whether its fundamental group splits as a free product. The special class
is built by attaching tubes to finite graphs in such a way that they
satisfy a nonpositive curvature condition. This construction gives rise to
a rich class of complexes, including, but not limited to, closed surfaces
of positive genus.
The algorithm can be used to deduce the celebrated Stallings theorem for
this special class, as also the well known Grushko decomposition theorem.

Title: Homogenization of Periodic Optimal Control Problems in a Domain
with highly oscillating boundary

Abstract: Homogenization is a branch of science where we try to understand
microscopic structures via a macroscopic medium. Hence, it has
applications in various branches of science and engineering. This study is
basically developed from material science in the creation of composite
materials though the contemporary applications are much far and wide. It
is a process of understanding the microscopic behavior of an
in-homogeneous medium via a homogenized medium. Mathematically, it is a
kind of asymptotic analysis. We plan to start with an illustrative example
of limiting analysis in 1-D for a second order elliptic partial
differential equation. We will also see some classical results in the case
of periodic composite materials and oscillating boundary domain. The
emphasis will be on the computational importance of homogenization in
numerics by the introduction of correctors. In the second part of the
talk, we will see a study on optimal control problems posed in a domain
with highly oscillating boundary. We will consider periodic controls in
the oscillating part of the domain with a model problem of Laplacian and
try to understand their optimality and asymptotic behavior.

Title: Iwasawa theory and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture:

Abstract: The celebrated BSD conjecture predicts a deep and mysterious
relationship between the algebraic rank of an elliptic curve
defined over a number field and an arithmetic invariant arising
front he L-function of the elliptic curve. More amazingly, it
predicts an exact formula for the leading term of the L-function.
Iwasawa theory has proven to be an effective tool in trying to
explain the philosophy behind such a mysterious relationship and
also in establishing the conjecture in certain cases. We shall
outline this theory and discuss  its applications.

Title: Twin Primes

Speaker: M. Ram Murty, Queen's University, Kingston, Canada

Date: Jan 4, 2016

Time: 4pm

Location: LH-1

Abstract: There is a folklore conjecture that there are infinitely
many primes p such that p+2 is also prime.
This conjecture is still open.  However, in the last two years,
spectacular progress has been made to show that there are
infinitely many primes p such that p+h is also prime with
1< h < 247.  We will discuss the history of this problem
and explain the new advances in sieve theory that have led
to these remarkable results.  We will also highlight what we may
expect in the future.

Title: Diamond lemma for group graded quasi-algebras

Abstract: Quasi-algebras were introduced as algebras in a monoidal
category. Since the associativity constraints in these categories are
allowed to be nontrivial, the class of quasi-algebras contains various
important examples of non-associative algebras like the octonions and
other Cayley algebras.
The diamond lemma is a reduction method used in algebra. The original
diamond lemma was stated in graph theory by Newman which was later
generalized to associative algebras by Bergman. In this talk, we will see
the analog of this lemma for the group graded quasi-algebras with some
interesting examples like octonion algebra and generalized octonions

Title: Hecke algebras and the Langlands program

Abstract: Given an irreducible polynomial f(x) with integer coefficients
and a prime number p, one wishes to determine whether f(x) is a product of
distinct linear factors modulo p. When f(x) is a solvable polynomial, this
question is satisfactorily answered by the Class Field Theory. Attempts to
find a non-abelian Class Field Theory lead to the development of an area
of mathematics called the Langlands program.
The Langlands program, roughly speaking, predicts a natural correspondence
between the finite dimensional complex representations of the Galois group
of a local or a number field and the infinite dimensional representations
of real, p-adic and adelic reductive groups. I will give an outline of the
statement of the local Langlands correspondence. I will then briefly talk
about two of the main approaches towards the Langlands program - the type
theoretic approach relying on the theory of types developed by
Bushnell-Kutzko and others; and the endoscopic approach relying on the
trace formula and endoscopy. I will then state a couple of my results
involving these two approaches.

Title: Upscaling of a System of Semilinear Diffusion&#8208;Reaction
Equations in a Heterogeneous Medium: Multi&#8208;Scale Modeling and
Periodic Homogenization.

Date : Jan 10

Time : 4 pm

Location:  LH-1


Abstract: A porous medium (concrete, soil, rocks, water reservoir, e.g.)
is a multi&#8208;scale medium

where the heterogeneities present in the medium are characterized by the
micro scale and the

global behaviors of the medium are observed at the macro scale. The
upscaling from the micro

scale to the macro scale can be done via averaging methods.

In this talk, diffusion and reaction of several mobile chemical species
are considered in

the pore space of a heterogeneous porous medium. The reactions amongst the
species are

modelled via mass action kinetics and the modelling leads to a system of
multi&#8208;species diffusion&#8208;

reaction equations (coupled semi&#8208;linear partial differential
equations) at the micro scale where

the highly nonlinear reaction rate terms are present at the right hand
sides of the system of PDEs,

cf. [2]. The existence of a unique positive global weak solution is shown
with the help of a

Lyapunov functional, Schaefer's fixed point theorem and maximal
Lp&#8208;regularity, cf. [2, 3]. Finally,

with the help of periodic homogenization and two&#8208;scale convergence
we upscale the model from

the micro scale to the macro scale, e.g. [1, 3]. Some numerical
simulations will also be shown in

this talk, however for the purpose of illustration, we restrict ourselves
to some relatively simple

2&#8208; dimensional situations.

As an extension to the previous model, we consider the mixture of two
fluids. For such

models, a system of Stokes&#8208;Cahn&#8208;Hilliard equations will be
considered at the micro scale in a

perforated porous medium. We first explain the periodic setting of the
model and the existence

results. At the end homogenization of the model will be shown using some
extension theorems

on Sobolev spaces, two&#8208;scale convergence and periodic unfolding.

Title: Exchangeable and stationary chains of quantum Gaussian states and
an integral formula for their entropy rates.

Speaker: K R Parthasarathy

Date: March 11, 2016

Location: LH-1

Time: 4 pm

Abstract: We shall introduce the definition of a k-mode Gaussian state
and a chain of such states which determine a C* probability space. We
present examples of such states exhibiting properties like
exchangeability and stationarity. Stationary chains are determined by
block Toeplitz matrices. Using the Kac-Murdoch-Szego theorems on
asymptotic spectral distributions of Toeplitz matrices we compute the
entropy rates of some of these chains. This leaves many natural problems
open.

Abstract: We
> consider a wave equation system with advection as a simple linearised
> model of the compressible Euler equation of gas dynamics. It is well
> known that the solutions of the compressible Euler equations in a
> low-mach number regime are good approximations of the solutions of the
> incompressible Euler equations. Due to this asymptotic convergence,
> numerical schemes designed only for the compressible equations suffer
> from several pathologies: reduction of order, lack of stability,
> inconsistency etc. In the present work, we consider a framework for
> analysing the above three difficulties by taking the wave equation
> with advection as a prototype model. Guided by a systematic multiscale
> asymptotic expansion, we split the fluxes into so called stiff and
> non-stiff parts. The non-stiff part is so designed that its Jacobian
> matrix always has finite eigenvalues, facilitating the use of standard
> upwind discretising procedures. On the other hand, the stiff part
> constitutes a wave equation system with very large wave speeds. We use
> an implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge-Kutta scheme for discretisation,
> therein the non-stiff part is treated explicitly and the stiff part
> implicitly. The key idea behind the loss of accuracy of compressible
> flow-solvers in low mach numbers is due to their inability to preserve
> a so-called well-prepared space of spatially constant densities and
> divergence free velocity fields. In the light of this, we prove that
> both our first and second order IMEX schemes preserve the well
> prepared space and hence they do not suffer from any inaccuracies when
> the Mach number goes to zero. We perform a stability analysis of the
> proposed schemes and show that the schemes are stable under ususal CFL
> like conditions which are solely dictated by the finite eigenvalues of
> the non-stiff fluxes. In addition, we also show that with an
> appropriate choice of a splitting parameter the numerical scheme is
> consistent with the limit equations even in the low mach number limit.

Title: A motivic formula for the $L$-function of an abelian variety over a
function field

Speaker: Bruno Kahn, University of Paris VI

Date: Jan 1, 2016

Time: 4 pm

Location: LH-1

If $A$ is an abelian variety over a global field $K$, its $L$-function
$L(A,s)$ is the object of the famous Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.
It is known that the case where $K$ has positive characteristic is easier
than the one where $K$ is a number field: for example, it is known in the
positive characteristic case that the rank of $A$ is bounded above by the
analytic rank. I will revisit this result by giving a formula for $L(A,s)$
in terms of zeta functions of motives associated to $A$, defined over the
field of constants of $K$ (a finite field). Further applications will be
given if time permits.

Title: Contact Structures and Contact Invariants in Heegaard Floer Homology.

Abstract: There is a dichotomy of contact structures-- tight vs
overtwisted. Classification of overtwisted contact structures up to
isotopy, due to Eliashberg, is well understood. However, there have been
few results towards classification of tight contact structures. In
general, given a contact structure it is difficult to know whether it is
tight or not.

In this talk, we focus on the role of certain element, called as contact
invariant, of Heegaard Floer homology groups associated with a given
contact structure in understanding tightness. We discuss success and
limitations of contact invariant in detecting tightness of contact
structures. In this direction, I will also present a recent result from
joint work with James Conway and Amey Kaloti.

In the first half of the talk, we will start from basics. Next, we will
survey important results from Contact Topology and Heegaard Floer Homology
relevant for the purpose of this talk. So, the first half will be
accessible to wide audience.

Title: Unique factorization of tensor products for finite-dimensional
simple Lie algebras

Abstract: Suppose V is a finite dimensional representation of a complex
finite dimensional simple Lie algebra that can be written as a tensor
product of irreducible representations. A theorem of C.S. Rajan states
that the non-trivial irreducible factors that occur in the tensor product
factorization of V are uniquely determined, up to reordering, by the
isomorphism class of V. I will present an elementary proof of Rajan's
theorem. This is a joint work with S.Viswanath.

Title: "Simultaneous Similarity Classes of tuples of Commuting matrices."

Speaker: Uday Bhaskar (IMSc, Chennai)

Date : Oct 7

Time : 11 AM

Location: LH-1


Abstract: The enumeration of isomorphism classes of modules of a
polynomial algebra in several variables over a finite field is the same as
the classifi cation of commuting tuples of matrices over a finite field up
to simultaneous similarity. Let C_{n,k}(q) denote the number of
isomorphism classes of n-dimensional Fq[x1,...,xk]-modules. The generating
function in k of the C_{n,k}(q) is a rational function. The computation of
this was done explicitly for n <= 4. I shall give a summary of my recently
published work on this study of the C_{n,k}(q)s for n <= 2.

Title: On some fourth order equations associated to Physics.

Abstract: We consider a fourth order traveling wave equation associated to
the Suspension Bridge Problem (SBP). This equations are modeled by the
traveling wave behavior on the Narrows Tacoma and the Golden Gate bridge.
We prove existence of homoclinic solutions when the wave speed is small.
We will also discuss the associated  fourth order Liouville theorem to the
problem and possible link with the De Giorgi's conjecture.  This is an
attempt to prove the McKenna-Walter conjecture which is open for the last
two decades.

Title: The Batalin-Vilkovisky structure on a  model  of the loop space
homology.

Abstract:  Let X be a closed,  simply connected and  orientable manifold of
dimension m and
LX the space of free loops on X.  We use Rational Homotopy Theory to
construct a
model
for the loop space homology. We further define a BV structure  which is
equivalent,
in some
cases,  to the Chas-Sullivan  BV operator.

Title: A hybrid HPC framework with analysis for a class of stochastic models

Abstract: We consider a class of wave propagation models with aleatoric
and epistemic uncertainties. Using mathematical analysis-based,
shape-independent, a priori parameter estimates, we develop offline/online
strategies to compute statistical moments of a key quantity of interest
in such models. We present  an efficient  reduced order model (ROM)
and high performance computing (HPC) framework with analysis for quantifying
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in the propagation of waves through
a stochastic media comprising  a large number of three dimensional
particles.
Simulation even for a single deterministic  three dimensional
configuration is inherently difficult because of the large number of
particles.
The aleatoric uncertainty in the model leads to a larger dimensional system
involving three spatial variables and additional stochastic variables.
Accounting for epistemic uncertainty in key parameters  of the input
probability distributions leads to prohibitive computational complexity.
Our hybrid ROM and HPC framework can be used in conjunction with any
computational method to simulate a single particle deterministic wave
propagation model.

Title: Approximate controllability of an impulsive sub-diffusion equation.

Abstract:
In this talk, I shall consider an abstract Cauchy problem for a class of
impulsive
sub-diffusion equation.
Existence and regularity of solution of the problem shall be established
via eigenfunction expansion.
Further, I shall establish the approximate controllability of the problem by
applying unique continuation property via internal control acts on a
sub-domain.

Title : Coarse Geometry for Noncommutative Spaces

Abstract: Abstract:
Given a proper coarse structure on a locally compact Hausdorff space $X$,
one can construct the Higson compactification for the coarse structure. In
the opposite direction given a compactification of $X$, one can construct
a coarse structure. We use unitizations of a non-unital C$^*$\nobreakdash-
algebra $A$ to define a noncommutative coarse structure on $A$. We also
set up a framework to abstract coarse maps to this noncommutative setting.
The original motivation for this work comes from Physics where quantum
phenomenon when probed at large scales give classical results. We show
equivalence of the canonical coarse structure on the classical plane
$\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ with a certain noncommutative coarse structure on the
Moyal plane which models the hypothetical phase space of Quantum physics.
If time permits we shall also discuss other examples of noncommutative
coarse equivalences. This is a joint work with Prof. Ralf Meyer.

Title: " Existence of Nash equilibrium for
chance-constrained games"

Abstract:
We consider an n-player strategic game with finite action sets. The payoffs
of each player are random variables. We assume that each player uses a
satisficing payoff criterion defined by a chance-constraint, i.e., players
face a chance-constrained game. We consider the cases where payoffs follow
normal and elliptically symmetric distributions. For both cases we show
that there always exists a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium of corresponding
chance-constrained game.

Title: A motivic formula for the $L$-function of an abelian variety over a
function field

Speaker: Bruno Kahn, University of Paris VI

Date: Jan 1, 2016

Time: 4 pm

Location: LH-1

If $A$ is an abelian variety over a global field $K$, its $L$-function
$L(A,s)$ is the object of the famous Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.
It is known that the case where $K$ has positive characteristic is easier
than the one where $K$ is a number field: for example, it is known in the
positive characteristic case that the rank of $A$ is bounded above by the
analytic rank. I will revisit this result by giving a formula for $L(A,s)$
in terms of zeta functions of motives associated to $A$, defined over the
field of constants of $K$ (a finite field). Further applications will be
given if time permits.

Title: The Batalin-Vilkovisky structure on a  model  of the loop space
homology.

Abstract:  Let X be a closed,  simply connected and  orientable manifold of
dimension m and
LX the space of free loops on X.  We use Rational Homotopy Theory to
construct a
model
for the loop space homology. We further define a BV structure  which is
equivalent,
in some
cases,  to the Chas-Sullivan  BV operator.

Title : Linking numbers for algebraic cycles

Date : Jan 18

Time : 4pm

Location : LH-1

Abstract: In algebraic geometry the concept of height pairing (a
particular example

of linking numbers) of algebraic cycles lies at the confluence of arithmetic,

Hodge theory and topology. In a series of two talks, I will explain the
notion

of Beilinson's height pairing for cycles homologous to zero. This will bring

into picture the notion of Arakelov/arithmetic intersection theory. I will
give

sufficient background of this theory and provide examples. Finally, I will
talk

about my recent work with Dr. Jose Ignacio Burgos, about a generalization

of Beilinson's height pairing for higher algebraic cycles.

Title: A result for boolean interval of finite groups

Abstract:

A group is cyclic iff its subgroup lattice is distributive. Ore's
generalized one direction of this result. We will discuss a dual version
of Ore's result, for any boolean interval of finite groups under the
assumption that the dual Euler totient of the interval is nonzero. We
conjecture that the dual Euler totient is always nonzero for boolean
intervals. We will discuss some techniques which may be helpful in proving
it. We first see that dual Euler totient of an interval of finite groups
is the Mobius invariant (upto a sign) of its coset poset P. Next in the
boolean group complemented case, we prove that P is Cohen-Macaulay, using
the existence of an explicit EL-labeling. We then see that nontrivial
betti number of the order complex is nonzero, and so is the dual Euler
totient.

Title: Relation between orbit spaces of unimodular elements and improved
stability bound

Abstract: This is a topic in classical algebraic K-Theory. I will recall
definitions of elementary linear group, elementary symplectic group,
linear transvection group, and symplectic transvection group. These group=
s
have natural action on the set of unimodular elements. I will briefly
discuss how bijections between orbit spaces of unimodular elements under
different group actions are established. Finally, I will talk about an
application of these results, namely improving injective stability bound
for the K1 group.

Title: Relation between orbit spaces of unimodular elements and improved
stability bound

Abstract: This is a topic in classical algebraic K-Theory. I will recall
definitions of elementary linear group, elementary symplectic group,
linear transvection group, and symplectic transvection group. These group=
s
have natural action on the set of unimodular elements. I will briefly
discuss how bijections between orbit spaces of unimodular elements under
different group actions are established. Finally, I will talk about an
application of these results, namely improving injective stability bound
for the K1 group.

Title: Koszul property of diagonal subalgebras of bigraded algebras.

Abstract:  Koszul algebras are the algebras over which the resolution of the
residue class field is given entirely by linear matrices. In this talk, we
shall first
review the classical invariant Castelnouvo-Mumford regularity of a
finitely generated
graded module $M$ over a commutative ring $R$ and define Koszul algebras
in terms of
regularity. I will give some examples to understand Castelnouvo-Mumford
regularity
and Koszul algebras. We shall also discuss several other characterizations of
Koszul algebras. Then I will present some results on Koszul property of
diagonal subalgebras of bigraded
algebras; in particular, Koszul property of diagonal subalgebras of Rees
algebras for a
complete intersection ideal generated by homogeneous forms of equal degrees.

Title - Entrywise functions preserving positivity:
Connections between analysis, algebra, and combinatorics


Abstract -
What functions preserve positive semidefiniteness (psd) when applied
entrywise to psd matrices? This question has a long history beginning with
Schur, Schoenberg, and Rudin, and has also recently received renewed
attention due to its applications in high-dimensional statistics. However,
effective characterizations of entrywise functions preserving positivity
in a fixed dimension remain elusive to date.

I will present recent progress on this question, obtained by: (a) imposing
rank and sparsity constraints, (b) restricting to structured matrices, and
(c) restricting the class of functions to special families such as
polynomials or power functions. These constraints arise in theory as well
as applications, and provide natural ways to relax the elusive original
problem. Moreover, novel connections to symmetric function theory, matrix
analysis, and combinatorics emerge out of these refinements.

Title: Upscaling of a System of Semilinear Diffusion&#8208;Reaction
Equations in a Heterogeneous Medium: Multi&#8208;Scale Modeling and
Periodic Homogenization.

Date : Jan 10

Time : 11 AM

Location:  LH-1


Abstract: A porous medium (concrete, soil, rocks, water reservoir, e.g.)
is a multi&#8208;scale medium

where the heterogeneities present in the medium are characterized by the
micro scale and the

global behaviors of the medium are observed at the macro scale. The
upscaling from the micro

scale to the macro scale can be done via averaging methods.

In this talk, diffusion and reaction of several mobile chemical species
are considered in

the pore space of a heterogeneous porous medium. The reactions amongst the
species are

modelled via mass action kinetics and the modelling leads to a system of
multi&#8208;species diffusion&#8208;

reaction equations (coupled semi&#8208;linear partial differential
equations) at the micro scale where

the highly nonlinear reaction rate terms are present at the right hand
sides of the system of PDEs,

cf. [2]. The existence of a unique positive global weak solution is shown
with the help of a

Lyapunov functional, Schaefer's fixed point theorem and maximal
Lp&#8208;regularity, cf. [2, 3]. Finally,

with the help of periodic homogenization and two&#8208;scale convergence
we upscale the model from

the micro scale to the macro scale, e.g. [1, 3]. Some numerical
simulations will also be shown in

this talk, however for the purpose of illustration, we restrict ourselves
to some relatively simple  dimensional situations.

As an extension to the previous model, we consider the mixture of two
fluids. For such

models, a system of Stokes ;Cahn ;Hilliard equations will be
considered at the micro scale in a

perforated porous medium. We first explain the periodic setting of the
model and the existence

results. At the end homogenization of the model will be shown using some
extension theorems

on Sobolev spaces, two&#8208;scale convergence and periodic unfolding.

Title : Nonequilibrium Markov processes conditioned on large deviations

Date: Nov 5 (Thursday)

Time: 4:00 pm

Location: LH-1

Abstract : I will present a general approach for constructing a Markov
process that describes the dynamics of a nonequilibrium process when one or
more observables of this process are observed to fluctuate in time away from
their typical values.

Title: When is $R[\theta]$  integrally closed?

Speaker: Prof Sudesh Kaur Khanduja

Affiliation: IISER, Mohali

Location : LH-1

Time : 11 AM

Abstract: Let $R$ be an integrally closed domain with quotient field $K$
and $\theta$ be an element of an  integral domain containing $R$ with
$\theta$  integral over $R$ and  $F(x)$ be the minimal polynomial of
$\theta$ over $K$. We shall discuss some necessary and sufficient
conditions to be  satisfied by $F(x)$ so that $R[\theta]$  is integrally
closed. We shall also give applications of the results for algebraic
number fields to have a power basis.

Title: Unique factorization of tensor products for finite-dimensional
simple Lie algebras

Abstract: Suppose V is a finite dimensional representation of a complex
finite dimensional simple Lie algebra that can be written as a tensor
product of irreducible representations. A theorem of C.S. Rajan states
that the non-trivial irreducible factors that occur in the tensor product
factorization of V are uniquely determined, up to reordering, by the
isomorphism class of V. I will present an elementary proof of Rajan's
theorem. This is a joint work with S.Viswanath.

Title: Approximate controllability of an impulsive sub-diffusion equation.

Abstract:
In this talk, I shall consider an abstract Cauchy problem for a class of
impulsive
sub-diffusion equation.
Existence and regularity of solution of the problem shall be established
via eigenfunction expansion.
Further, I shall establish the approximate controllability of the problem by
applying unique continuation property via internal control acts on a
sub-domain.

Title: Enumerative Geometry of rational cuspidal curves on del-Pezzo
surfaces.

Abstract: Enumerative geometry is a branch of mathematics that deals
with the following question: "How many geometric objects are there that
satisfy certain constraints?" The simplest example of such a question is
"How many lines pass through two points?". A more interesting question
is "How many lines are there in three dimensional space that intersect
four generic lines?". An extremely important class of enumerative question
is to ask "How many rational (genus 0) degree d curves are there in
CP^2 that pass through 3d-1 generic points?" Although this question
was investigated in the nineteenth century, a complete solution to this
problem was unknown until the early 90's, when Kontsevich-Manin
and Ruan-Tian announced a formula. In this talk we will discuss some
natural generalizations of the above question; in particular we will be
looking
at rational curves on del-Pezzo surfaces that have a cuspidal singularity.
We
will describe a topological method to approach such questions. If time
permits, we will also explain the idea of how to enumerate genus one
curves with a fixed complex structure by comparing it with the Symplectic
Invariant of a manifold (which are essentially the number of curves that
are
solutions to the perturbed d-bar equation).

Title: Contact Structures and Contact Invariants in Heegaard Floer Homology.

Abstract: There is a dichotomy of contact structures-- tight vs
overtwisted. Classification of overtwisted contact structures up to
isotopy, due to Eliashberg, is well understood. However, there have been
few results towards classification of tight contact structures. In
general, given a contact structure it is difficult to know whether it is
tight or not.

In this talk, we focus on the role of certain element, called as contact
invariant, of Heegaard Floer homology groups associated with a given
contact structure in understanding tightness. We discuss success and
limitations of contact invariant in detecting tightness of contact
structures. In this direction, I will also present a recent result from
joint work with James Conway and Amey Kaloti.

In the first half of the talk, we will start from basics. Next, we will
survey important results from Contact Topology and Heegaard Floer Homology
relevant for the purpose of this talk. So, the first half will be
accessible to wide audience.

Title: Wild Topology, Group Theory and a conjecture in Number Theory

Date and Time: Wednesday, March 2, 2016, 4:00 p.m.

Venue: LH-1, Department of Mathematics

Abstract: One of the most useful analogies in mathematics is the
fundamental group functor (also known as the Galois Correspondence) which
sends a topological space to its fundamental group while at the same time
sending continuous maps between spaces to corresponding homomorphisms of
groups in such a way that compositions of maps are preserved.

A an obvious question one might ask is whether the fundamental group
functor is "onto", that is: (1) is every group the fundamental group of a
space and (2) every homomorphism the image of a continuous map between
corresponding spaces?  The easy answer to (1) is "yes" and the nonobvious
answer to (2) is "it depends on the spaces".

We'll introduce the harmonic archipelago as the shining example of a spac=
e
with a strange fundamental group, define an archipelago of groups as a
group theoretic
product operation and finally describe how such products are (almost) all
isomorphic to the fundamental group of the harmonic archipelago.

We will study examples showing that there are group homomorphisms that
cannot be induced by continuous maps on certain spaces and how the
fundamental group of the harmonic archipelago factors through all such
"discontinuous homomorphisms", how none of the examples is constructible
(or even understandable in any reasonable way) and how one might detect
spaces whose fundamental group allows them to be the codomain of such wei=
rd
homomorphisms (the conjecture is that they contain the rational numbers o=
r
torsion).

We'll talk a bit about the notion of cotorsion groups from classical
Abelian group theory and how that notion can be generalized to non-Abelia=
n
groups by requiring certain types of systems of equations have solutions
and then mention how countable groups which have solutions to such system=
s
are always images of the fundamental group of an archipelago.

In the end we're lead to an example of a countable group which we can pro=
ve
is either the rational numbers or gives a counterexample to a nearly 50
year old conjecture in number theory:  the Kurepa conjecture.  So there i=
s
a little topology, a little homotopy theory, some group theory, a pinch o=
f
logic and a wisp of number theory in the talk.  This is a distillation of
work I've published recently with Hojka and Meilstrup (Proc AMS) and work
that is still being written up with Hojka and Herfort.

Title: Wild Topology, Group Theory and a conjecture in Number Theory<br>
<br>
Date and Time: Wednesday, March 2, 2016, 4:00 p.m.<br>
<br>
Venue: LH-1, Department of Mathematics<br>
<br>
Abstract: One of the most useful analogies in mathematics is the<br>
fundamental group functor (also known as the Galois Correspondence) which<b=
r>
sends a topological space to its fundamental group while at the same time<b=
r>
sending continuous maps between spaces to corresponding homomorphisms of<br>
groups in such a way that compositions of maps are preserved.<br>
<br>
A an obvious question one might ask is whether the fundamental group<br>
functor is &quot;onto&quot;, that is: (1) is every group the fundamental gr=
oup of a<br>
space and (2) every homomorphism the image of a continuous map between<br>
corresponding spaces?=C2=A0 The easy answer to (1) is &quot;yes&quot; and t=
he nonobvious<br>
answer to (2) is &quot;it depends on the spaces&quot;.<br>
<br>
We&#39;ll introduce the harmonic archipelago as the shining example of a sp=
ace<br>
with a strange fundamental group, define an archipelago of groups as a<br>
group theoretic<br>
product operation and finally describe how such products are (almost) all<b=
r>
isomorphic to the fundamental group of the harmonic archipelago.<br>
<br>
We will study examples showing that there are group homomorphisms that<br>
cannot be induced by continuous maps on certain spaces and how the<br>
fundamental group of the harmonic archipelago factors through all such<br>
&quot;discontinuous homomorphisms&quot;, how none of the examples is constr=
uctible<br>
(or even understandable in any reasonable way) and how one might detect<br>
spaces whose fundamental group allows them to be the codomain of such weird=
<br>
homomorphisms (the conjecture is that they contain the rational numbers or<=
br>
torsion).<br>
<br>
We&#39;ll talk a bit about the notion of cotorsion groups from classical<br>
Abelian group theory and how that notion can be generalized to non-Abelian<=
br>
groups by requiring certain types of systems of equations have solutions<br>
and then mention how countable groups which have solutions to such systems<=
br>
are always images of the fundamental group of an archipelago.<br>
<br>
In the end we&#39;re lead to an example of a countable group which we can p=
rove<br>
is either the rational numbers or gives a counterexample to a nearly 50<br>
year old conjecture in number theory:=C2=A0 the Kurepa conjecture.=C2=A0 So=
 there is<br>

Title: The Narasimhan Seshadri Theorem revisited

Abstract: We give a relatively simple proof of the famous theorem of
Narasimhan and Seshadri on vector bundles on a compact Riemann surface.
The theorem relates the algebraic geometric notion of stability of vector
bundles on a compact Riemann surface with a transcendental construct -
unitary representations of a suitable Fuchsian group associated to the
Riemann surface.

Title: Hochschild and cyclic homology of algebraic non-commutative torus
orbifold and Chern-Connes pairing.

Speaker: Safdar Quddus (NISER, Odisha)

Time: 3 pm

Location: LH-1

Abstract: The algebraic non-commutative torus gives via the action of
Z/2Z, Z/3Z, Z/4Z and Z/6Z, four orbifolds. The Hochschild and cyclic
cohomology of smooth non-commutative torus were computed by Connes in
1985. We calculate the these homologies for algebraic orbiolfds, we also
study the Chern-Connes pairing, which is a generalised understanding of
the classical Chern pairing/index. While Chern index was a useful
imvariant in the classical case, so is Chern-Connes pairing in the
non-commutative setup. We compute the Chern-Connes index for the algebraic
non-commutative Z/2Z torus orbifold.

Title of Talk:  Adaptive wavelet-based methods for solution of PDEs and
signal analysis.

Abstract of Talk:

A dynamic adaptive numerical method for solving partial differential
equations (PDEs) on the sphere is necessary to solve problems with
localized structures or sharp transitions. The numerical solution of such
problems on uniform grids is impractical, since high-resolution
computations are required only in regions where sharp transitions occur. An
adaptive wavelet collocation method provides a robust method for
controlling spatial grid adaptation -- fine grid spacing in regions where a
solution varies greatly (i.e., near steep gradients, or near-singularities)
and a much coarser grid where the solution varies slowly, which I will
discuss in this talk. Further, developing a truly adaptive method for
signal analysis is important for the understanding of many natural
phenomena. I will discuss the analysis of a variant of the second order
synchrosqueezing transform to deal with modes containing strong frequency
modulated signal.

Title: Localisation theorems for Bochner-Riesz means.

Abstract:- Define
$S_R^{\alpha}f:=\int_{\R^d}(1-\frac{|\xi|^2}{R^2})_{+}^{\alpha}\hat{f}(\xi)\exp^{i2\pi
x.\xi}d\xi,$ the Bochner Riesz means of order $\alpha\geq 0.$ Let $f\in
L^2(\R^d)$ and $f\eq 0$ in an open, bounded set $B.$ Its known that
$S_R^{\alpha}f goes to 0 a.e. in $B$ as $R\rightarrow\infty.$ We study the
pointwise convergence of Bochner Riesz means $S_{R}^{\alpha}f, \alpha>0$ as
$\R$\rightarrow \infty$
on sets of positive Hausdorff measure in $\R^d$ by making use of the decay
of the spherical means of Fourier Transform of fractal measures. We get an
improvement in the range of the Hausdorff dimension of the sets on which it
converges. When $0<\alpha<\frac{d-1}{4}$ we get the best possible result in
$\R^2$ and in higher dimensions we improve the result by L.Colzani, G.
Gigante and A. Vargas. Stein's interpolation theorem also gives us  the
corresponding
result for $f\in L^p(\R^d), 1<p<2.$

Title: Domains of holomorphy for irreducible admissible Banach
representations

Abstract: In this talk, we'll report on progress towards a conjecture of
B.Kr'tz about the holomorphic extensions of  non-zero K-finite vectors of
irreducible admissible Banach representations of simple real Lie groups and
the relation to a distinguished domain - the so-called crown domain. We'll
explain some of the main ideas - the Casselman-Wallach smooth
globalisation, vanishing of matrix coefficients at infinity etc. Indeed we
prove the conjecture with some additional growth conditions on the Banach
globalisations. This is joint work with Gang Liu, Uni. Metz.

Title: Some Recent Progress in Quasilinear Hyperbolic Systems: New Local
Solvability
Methods and Stochastic Analysis.

Abstract: Quasilinear symmetric and symmetrizable hyperbolic system has a
wide range
of
applications in engineering and physics including unsteady Euler and
potential
equations of
gas dynamics, inviscid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, shallow water
equations,
non-Newtonian fluid dynamics, and Einstein  field equations of general
relativity.
In the past,
the Cauchy problem of smooth solutions for these systems has been studied
by several
mathematicians using semigroup approach and fixed point arguments. In a
recent work
of M.
T. Mohan and S. S. Sritharan, the local solvability of symmetric
hyperbolic system is
established using two different methods, viz. local monotonicity method and a
frequency
truncation method. The local existence and uniqueness of solutions of
symmetrizable
hyperbolic system is also proved by them using a frequency truncation
method. Later
they
established the local solvability of the stochastic quasilinear symmetric
hyperbolic
system
perturbed by Levy noise using a stochastic generalization of the localized
Minty-Browder
technique. Under a smallness assumption on the initial data, a global
solvability
for the
multiplicative noise case is also proved. The essence of this talk is to
give an
overview of
these new local solvability methods and their applications.

Title: The restriction of discrete series representations to minimal
parabolic subgroups - the case of Spin(4,1)

Speaker Aprameyan Parthasarthy, Universitat Paderborn, Germany

Date: Sept 30, 2015

Time: 4pm

Location: LH1

Abstract:  In this talk we'll discuss  some ideas concerning the
restriction problem discrete series representations of a real
reductive  group G  to a  (minimal)  parabolic subgroup  P.  As  a first
example in  the non-Hermitian  case, we study  Spin(4,1) -  an example
that is interesting  in itself, and also serves as  a test case for
our general  strategy.  Motivated by geometric  considerations we show
that  only finitely  many discrete  series of  P appear  with non-zero
multiplicity in  the restriction, in  contrast to the  Hermitian case.
Our  work  is  related  to  certain conjectures  of  Duflo  about  the
geometric nature  of the Plancherel  theorem. This is joint  work with
Gang Liu (Uni. Metz, France).

Title: Control and analysis of Shell model of Turbulence
Abstract:

In this lecture I am going to present control problems associated with
shell models of Turbulence. Shell models of turbulence are simplified
caricatures of equations of fluid mechanics in wave-vector representation.
 They exhibit anomalous scaling and local non-linear interactions in wave
number space. We would like to study control problem related to one such
widely accepted shell model of turbulence known as sabra shell model. We
associate two cost functionals: one ensures minimizing  turbulence in the
system and the other addresses the need of taking the ow near a priori
known state. We derive the optimal controls in terms of the solution of
adjoint equation for corresponding linearised problems.

Title: 'On commutators of singular integral operators with BMO functions'

Abstract : Commutators of singular integral operators with BMO functions
were introduced in the seventies by Coifman-Rochberg and Weiss. These
operators are very interesting for many reasons, one of them being the
fact that they are more singular than Calder &#769;on-Zygmundm operators.
In this lecture we plan to give several reasons showing the 'bad' behavior
of these operators.

Title: Iwasawa theory and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture:

Abstract: The celebrated BSD conjecture predicts a deep and mysterious
relationship between the algebraic rank of an elliptic curve
defined over a number field and an arithmetic invariant arising
front he L-function of the elliptic curve. More amazingly, it
predicts an exact formula for the leading term of the L-function.
Iwasawa theory has proven to be an effective tool in trying to
explain the philosophy behind such a mysterious relationship and
also in establishing the conjecture in certain cases. We shall
outline this theory and discuss  its applications.

Title:  Chromatic polynomials of graphs from Kac-Moody algebras.

Abstract:  Given a simple graph G, the Kac-Moody Lie algebra of G is the
Kac-Moody algebra whose simply laced Dynkin diagram is G. We give a new
interpretation of the chromatic polynomial of G in terms of the Kac-Moody
Lie algebra of G. We show that the chromatic polynomial is essentially th=
e
q-Kostant partition function of the associated Kac-Moody algebra evaluate=
d
on the sum of the simple roots. As an application, we construct basis of
some of the root spaces of the Kac-Moody algebra of G. This is a joint
work with Sankaran Viswanath.

Title: A glimpse at bi-free probability.

Abstract: I will provide a glimpse at the recent extension of free
probability to systems with left and right variables based on a notion of
bi-freeness. This will
include the simplest cases of nonlinear convolution operations on
non-commutative distributions snd the analogue of extreme values in this
setting.

Title: On some fourth order equations associated to Physics.

Abstract: We consider a fourth order traveling wave equation associated to
the Suspension Bridge Problem (SBP). This equations are modeled by the
traveling wave behavior on the Narrows Tacoma and the Golden Gate bridge.
We prove existence of homoclinic solutions when the wave speed is small.
We will also discuss the associated  fourth order Liouville theorem to the
problem and possible link with the De Giorgi's conjecture.  This is an
attempt to prove the McKenna-Walter conjecture which is open for the last
two decades.

Title: Finite point configurations

Abstract:
As big data sets have become more common, there has been significant
interest in finding and understanding patterns in them. One example of a
simple pattern is the distance between data points, which can be thought of
as a 2-point configuration. Two classic questions, the Erdos distinct
distance problem, which asks about the least number of distinct distances
determined by N points in the plane, and its continuous analog, the
Falconer distance problem, explore that simple pattern. Questions similar
to the Erdos distinct distance problem and the Falconer distance problem
can also be posed for more complicated patterns such as triangles, which
can be viewed as 3-point configurations. In this talk I will present recent
Falconer type theorems, established by myself and my collaborators, for a
wide class of finite point configurations in any dimension. The techniques
we used come from analysis and geometric measure theory, and the key step
was to obtain bounds on multilinear analogues of generalized Radon
transforms.
