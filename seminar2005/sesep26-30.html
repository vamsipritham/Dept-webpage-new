    Differentiation is a process which gives a linear approximation of a 
    function near a given point in its domain of definition. This process, which 
    is developed, a priori, over domains in the Euclidean space $R^n$, can be 
    transferred to other smooth geometric objects.<br>
    <br>
    Such generality is forced on one, if one wants to study problems in geometry 
    and physics. For example, differential equations regarding heat have to be 
    studied on the (insulated) surface in which heat distribution takes place. 
    Hydrodynamical flows take place in three dimensions, general<br>
    relativity studies a 4-dimensional object, and so on.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
    <br>
    The proper framework for this study is that of differential manifolds, 
    tensor fields on them and differential equations governing them. This short 
    course will deal with the formalism which enables such a study.</font></p>

    Professor S. Ramanan is one of the leading mathematicians of the country. He 
    is internationally recognised as an outstanding expert in Algebraic Geometry 
    (especially in the area of modulii problems). He has also done some very 
    beautiful work in Differential Geometry: his joint paper with<br>
    M.S. Narasimhan on Universal Connections has been very influential: it 
    enabled (among other things) S.S. Chern and B. Simons to introduce what is 
    known as the Chern-Simons invariant which has proved useful in Theoretical 
    Physics.<br>
    <br>
    Ramanan retired as Distinguished Professor in the School of Mathematics of 
    Tata Institute of Fundamental Researh (TIFR), Mumbai. He is a brilliant 
    expositor of mathematics, with a broad scholarship. He is a Fellow of all 
    the three national science academies and is a recipient of the Shanti<br>
    Swarup Bhatnagar Prize and the Third World Academy of Sciences Prize for 
    Mathematics. He has been a visiting professor at many leading universities 
    in the world. In 1978 he gave one of the prestigious 50-minute invited talks 
    at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Helsinki, and has also 
    been speaker at many major international conferences. In 1999, he was 
    extended the privilege of speaking on some aspects of the work of Andr Weil, 
    one of 20th century~Rs greatest mathematicians, on the occasion of his being 
    awarded the prestigious Inamouri Prize. Ramanan has written an excellent 
    book on Differential Geometry, entitled ~SGlobal Calculus~T, published 
    recently by the American Mathematical Society.</font><br>

    <font face="Verdana" size="2">The role of mathematics in every human 
    endeavour has been increasing rapidly over the last several decades. And 
    Mathematics itself has grown at a tremendous pace over these years. It is 
    important that our mathematical community keeps pace with these 
    developments. Members of the community and students need exposure to these 
    fast developments. The Mathematical Panorama Lectures is a series of short 
    courses on diverse mathematical topics planned by NBHM to meet this need. 
    The courses are to be given by outstanding experts in the different fields 
    at suitable venues in<br>
    different metros. Many of them will be arranged in Bangalore with the 
    cooperation of the Indian Institute of Science. Each course will attempt to 
    take its audience through a mathematical topic of current interest beginning 
    from some basic material and leading up to some relatively recent 
    developments in the field. The courses will provide opportunities for 
    mathematicians to get acquainted with areas with which they are not 
    familiar, and also serve as introductions to these areas to students and 
    research scholars. NBHM expects these courses to encourage the spread of<br>
    wide scholarship in mathematics in the mathematical community, especially 
    among the up-coming generation of talented youngsters. It is also proposed 
    to video record the lectures and make them accessible from various websites.<br>

    Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in 2010 (in New Delhi). ICM which takes 
    place once in 4 years is by far the most important meeting of the 
    international mathematical community. It is at the ICMs that the Fields 
    Medal, considered the<br>
    equivalent of the Nobel Prize (which is not available to mathematics) is 
    awarded (to upto 4 mathematicians). The Mathematical Panorama Lectures among 
    other things aim to help the mathematical community in the country to derive 
    the maximum benefit from such a big event, at which our mathematicians will 
    have the opportunity of interacting with the very best minds visiting India 
    and delivering lectures at the ICM; many of them are likely to spend 
    extended periods of time before and after the meeting. ICM itself is built 
    around some 20 odd ~Splenary talks~T (in which some of the most eminent 
    mathematicians will give the general mathematical audience an overview of 
    important developments in their fields) and about 200 other invited talks
